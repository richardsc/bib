 annote={The beginning of the SLEIWEX papers. Evidence of IWs by
                  georectified images, and some echosounder
                  timeseries. Analysis of the georectified images,
                  along with velocity and density profiles shows the
                  path of the waves as they move toward the Island
                  bank. Use the laterally averaged model (nonlinear
                  and nonhydrostatic) to examine properties of the
                  waves compared to KdV theory, and find that for the
                  observed waves (echogram) the KdV is not sufficient
                  to describe lengthscale, amplitude, or phase speed.
                  They do however find a good agreement for wave
                  energy by comparing that calculated from the model
                  with that predicted by KdV. Using this they
                  calculate the energy of the observed wavetrain. They
                  determine negligible energy is lost to shear, and a
                  small calculable fraction to bottom friction. The
                  using results from lab experiments (Michallet and
                  Ivey 1999) they estimate the increase in potential
                  energy due to mixing caused by the breaking
                  wave. From this, they then estimate the eddy
                  diffusivity, which when compared to the results of a
                  numerical model at that locale, is 50 times greater,
                  suggesting the importance of mixing due to internal
                  waves in specific regions.},

Usually this interaction stress is identical with the radiation stress of a uniform plane wave. The problem of internal gravity wave propagation in an incompressible, stratified Boussinesq liquid is considered in detail for a more general basic flow than has hitherto been treated, and the interaction stress is derived. One component of the interaction stress tensor is only equal to the corresponding component of the radiation stress tensor if we include in the latter, in addition to the Reynolds stress, a term associated with the redistribution of matter, on the average, by the wave. Two other components of the radiation stress tensor are modified in a similar manner, but the corresponding components of the interaction stress tensor are undefined, and so no comparison is possible.},

  abstract={A third-generation numerical wave model to compute random, short-crested waves in coastal regions with shallow water and ambient currents (Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN)) has been developed, implemented, and validated. The model is based on a Eulerian formulation of the discrete spectral balance of action density that accounts for refractive propagation over arbitrary bathymetry and current fields. It is driven by boundary conditions and local winds. As in other third-generation wave models, the processes of wind generation, whitecapping, quadruplet wave-wave interactions, and bottom dissipation are represented explicitly. In SWAN, triad wave-wave interactions and depth-induced wave breaking are added. In contrast to other third-generation wave models, the numerical propagation scheme is implicit, which implies that the computations are more economic in shallow water. The model results agree well with analytical solutions, laboratory observations, and (generalized) field observations.},

This model incorporates all relevant wave-current interaction mechanisms including changes of absolute frequencies due to unsteadiness of depth and currents. The model furthermore explicitly accounts for growth and decay of wave energy and for nonlinear resonant wave-wave interactions. The numerical schemes for propagation are basically second-order accurate. Effect of refraction and frequency shifts (due to unsteadiness of depth and current) are calculated on a fixed grid, also using second-order schemes. This paper focuses on the governing equations and the numerical algorithms. Furthermore some results for academic and realistic cases are presented to illustrate some features and merits of the model.},

  annote={Lamb examines the formation of trapped cores for shoaling
                  solitary waves of depression, with a variety of
                  different stratifications, and shelf widths. He uses
                  an exponential stratification (with 3 different
                  scale heights of 15, 35, and 75 m), a tanh profile
                  with scale heights of 20 and 45 m (making them
                  similar to the exponential profiles), and a
                  mixed-layer profile which is a modification of the
                  S=15m exponential to include a 2 m thick surface
                  mixed layer. There are 3 limits to wave amplitude
                  that are of relevance. The breaking limit occurs
                  when the maximum velocity in the wave ($U_{max}$) is
                  equal to the wave speed $c$. At this point, a
                  streamline in a reference frame moving with the
                  wave, first becomes vertical. The conjugate flow
                  limit occurs for waves that become flat in the
                  centre and simply become longer as the amplitude
                  increases (Benjamin 1966, Lamb and Wan
                  1998). Finally, the stability limit occurs when the
                  minimum Richardson number near the wave goes below
                  0.25, though this is not a set in stone criterion,
                  as the flow in a NLIW is not parallel.  \\Note that
                  a trapped core occurs when a wave core exhibits
                  closed streamlines. Trapped cores are significant
                  because they have the potential to transport fluid
                  over large distances.  \\ By comparing theoretical
                  properties of waves for the exponential and
                  mixed-layer stratifications, Lamb shows that the
                  maximum wave currents in large solitary waves are
                  sensitive to changes in the near-surface density.
                  \\Numerical experiments illustrate many aspects of
                  varying amplitude waves shoaling over the shelf for
                  the indicated stratifications, and for 3 different
                  shelf widths of 200, 400, and 600 m. Structure of
                  the trapped cores, evolution of wave amplitudes and
                  velocities, and breaking depths are all elucidated
                  with detailed figures. Some preliminary energetics
                  calculations are also performed.  \\ Results
                  indicate that trapped cores can form after breaking
                  for the exponential and tanh stratifications, but
                  \emph{do not} occur for the mixed layer
                  profile. While the maximum amplitude of the solitary
                  waves after adjusting on the shallower shelf (and
                  perhaps after having formed a trapped core) is
                  usually governed by the breaking limit, the
                  amplitude for waves in the mixed-layer case is
                  instead governed by the conjugate flow
                  limit. Breaking for trapped core forming waves can
                  occur on the shelf, while for the mixed-layer it
                  always occurs over the slope. These results imply
                  that waves with trapped cores will not be formed in
                  the ocean under most oceanographic conditions.  \\
                  \\ \textbf{Some extra notes on limits for large
                  amplitude waves:} \\ ISW amplitude is limited by one
                  of 3 things: the breaking limit, the conjugate flow
                  limit, and the stability limit. Different limits are
                  important for different stratifications and
                  configurations.  \\ The breaking limit occurs when
                  $U_{max} = c$, at which point overturning occurs and
                  a trapped core may be formed.  \\ For waves governed
                  by the conjugate flow limit, $U_{max} < c$ and
                  trapped cores are not formed, even if breaking
                  occurs. Higher energy waves become broader instead
                  of higher, and all streamlines are open.},

                  extended KdV (eKdV) as a weakly nonlinear model,
                  which includes a cubic nonlinearity term (Djordjevic
                  and Redekopp 1978) \[ \eta_t + (c_0 + \alpha_1 \eta
                  + \alpha_2 \eta^2) \eta_x + \beta_1 \eta_{xxx} = 0
                  \] which has a solitary wave solution \[ \eta =
                  \frac{\eta_0}{b + (1-b)\mathrm{cosh}^2 \gamma
                  (x-ct)} \] which reduces to the familiar sech$^2$
                  when $\alpha_2=0$.  Large amplitude models include
                  MCC (which agrees with eKdV for $0.4 <
                  \frac{h_1}{h_1 + h_2} < 0.6$). Also discussed is the
                  theory of Ostrovsky and Grue 2003, which does not
                  suffer from KH instability of large amplitude waves
                  like MCC. The equation is the phenomenological
                  derivation of KdV \[ \eta_t + c(\eta)\eta_x + (\beta
                  (\eta) \eta_{xx})_x = 0 \] where $c(\eta)$ is the
                  exact nonlinear speed from nondispersive theory.
                  Also discuss various authors that consider fully
                  nonlinear models (e.g. see Lamb 2002/2003,
                  Turkington 1991). \\Then they summarize various lab
                  experiments. \\Wave generation by tides (Halpern
                  1971): initial generation of a front upstream due to
                  ``blocking" by topography, nonlinear steepening of
                  the front, then generation of a wave packet by the
                  combined effects of nonlinearity and
                  dispersion. Also discuss Knight Inlet where the
                  plunging thermocline causes the accelerating lower
                  layer flow to become unstable to shear instabilities
                  which may develop into ISWs. \\Evolution is governed
                  by changes in topography and stratification, and
                  rotation. In particular they note the recently
                  detected waves of elevation (Klymak and Moum 2003,
                  etc) which often show transitions from waves of
                  depression to elevation (e.g. South China Sea). The
                  effect of rotation generally is to damp solitary
                  wave solutions, often through radiation of Poincare
                  waves.  They discussion dissipation due to its
                  importance for transport and mixing. Methods of
                  dissipation are: radiation damping (NLIWs
                  propagating over a weakly stratified lower layer may
                  radiate internal waves into it), boundary shear
                  (e.g. bottom boundary shear/turbulence/dissipation),
                  shear instability ($Ri < 1/4$ can produce thickening
                  of the interface - i.e. greater PE at the expense of
                  the ISWs, most likely caused by KH instability - see
                  Moum et al 2003), and wave breaking. Breaking often
                  occurs in the vicinity of the turning point ($h_1 =
                  h_2$), and is followed by the formation of
                  boluses. Lamb 2003 examined the idea of trapped
                  cores. Mixing efficiency as a result of breaking is
                  usually between 15-25 \%.},

  abstract={Wintertime stratification on Oregon's continental shelf
                  often produces a near-bottom layer of dense fluid
                  that acts as an internal waveguide upon which
                  nonlinear internal waves propagate. Shipboard
                  profiling and bottom lander observations capture
                  disturbances that exhibit properties of internal
                  solitary waves, bores and gravity
                  currents. Wave-like pulses are highly turbulent
                  (instantaneous bed stresses are 1 N m^2),
                  resuspending bottom sediments into the water column
                  and raising them 30+ m above the seafloor. The waves’
                  cross-shelf transport of fluid counters the
                  time-averaged Ekman transport in the bottom boundary
                  layer.  In the nonlinear internal waves we have
                  observed, the kinetic energy is roughly equal to the
                  available potential energy and is O(0.1) MJ per m of
                  coastline. The energy transported by these waves
                  includes a nonlinear advection term huEi that is
                  negligible in linear internal waves. Unlike linear
                  internal waves, the pressure-velocity energy flux

                  nonhydrostatic effects and surface displacement. It
                  is found that, statistically, <uE> ~=
                  2<up>. Vertical profiles through these waves of
                  elevation indicate that up(z) is more important in
                  transporting energy near the seafloor while uE(z)
                  dominates farther from the bottom. With the wave
                  speed, c, estimated from weakly nonlinear wave
                  theory, it is verified experimentally that the total
                  energy transported by the waves, <up>+<uE> ~= c<E>.
                  The high but intermittent energy flux by the waves
                  is, in an averaged sense, O(100)W per m of
                  coastline.  This is similar to independent estimates
                  of the shoreward energy flux in the semidiurnal
                  internal tide at the shelfbreak.},

                  They decompose the pressure distribution associated

                  2006): the internal hydrostatic pressure (from
                  isopycnal displacement), external hydrostatic
                  pressure (from free surface displacement), and a
                  nonhydrostatic pressure (from vertical
                  accelerations). Their framework gives \[
                  \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial
                  f_E}{\partial x} + \mbox{vertical redistribution} =
                  -\rho_0 \epsilon \] with the horizontal energy flux
                  as \[ f_E = u(KE + APE + p_h^w + \rho_0 g \eta_H +
                  p_{nh}) \] \[ f_E = uE + up \] where $uE$ is a
                  nonlinear advection term. They ultimately show that
                  $\langle f_E\rangle = c\langle E\rangle $ (or
                  $\langle uE + up\rangle = c\langle E\rangle $) holds
                  for the observed wave, and also that $\langle
                  uE\rangle \simeq 2\langle up\rangle $. In addition
                  they find that the nonhydrostatic and external
                  pressure contribute significantly to the total
                  pressure-velocity flux, and act to reduce it because
                  they are of the opposite sign to the hydrostatic
                  part. Also find an equipartition of KE and APE. They
                  also determine that $\rho_0 \epsilon$ is negligible

                  series do not coincide, however they focus on the
                  high res lander data for the energy
                  calculations. Also of note is that they plot
                  vertical profiles of fluxes rather than just
                  vertically integrated (fig. 15).},

                  densities and fluxes resulting from the propagation
                  of internal waves of arbitrary amplitude is derived
                  using the concept of available potential energy. The
                  method can be applied to numerical, laboratory or
                  field data. The total energy flux is shown to be the
                  sum of the linear energy flux $\int u'p'\,{\rm d}z$

                  violated, especially when the nonlinear waves begin
                  to interact with the bottom.},

                  of KE and APE can be violated.  The theory is
                  somewhat hard to follow, but the idea seems to be
                  that they develop their energy equation relative to
                  a reference state that is generally defined, as
                  follows. Let $\bar{\rho} = \bar{\rho}(z,t)$ be a
                  stable reference state. Then $z^*(s,t)$ is such that
                  $\bar{\rho}(z^*(s,t),t) = s$. \emph{$z^*$ is the
                  level at which a density $s$ resides in the
                  reference state????} Then \[ \psi =
                  \int_{\rho_0}^{\rho} gz^* ds \] where $\rho =
                  \rho(\mathbf{x},t)$ and $\mathrm{min}(\rho) < \rho_0
                  < \mathrm{max}(\rho)$. $\psi$ is some kind of
                  potential energy, like the potential energy at a
                  level $\rho$ referenced to $\rho_0$? Is basically a
                  generally defined reference state. $\psi$ can also
                  be written as \[ \psi = \int_{\bar{\rho}}^{\rho} g
                  z^* ds + \bar{\rho}gz - \rho_0 g z_0(t) - g
                  \int_{z_0(t)}^z\bar{\rho} dz' \] where $z_0(t) =
                  z^*(\rho_0,t)$, so that the APE is \[ E_p = \rho gz
                  - \psi.  \] \\ They also include viscous and
                  diffusive terms, which would mean that the reference
                  density state is time dependent. \emph{There is a
                  close connection here with section 2.2 of Lamb 2007,
                  and working these together may help me sort this
                  out}. Their final energy equation is: \[
                  \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(E_k + E_p) + \nabla
                  \cdot( \vec{u}(P + E_k + E_p)) = \nabla^2( \nu E_k +
                  \kappa E_p) - \epsilon_k - \epsilon_p - 2g \kappa
                  \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(\rho - \bar{\rho}) - g
                  \int_{\bar{\rho}}^{\rho} \frac{\partial
                  z^*}{\partial t} ds \] where $P$ is the deviation
                  from hydrostatic pressure distribution associated
                  with the reference state, and the terms on the right
                  are: diffusion, conversion of energy (KE and PE) to
                  internal energy (heat) through viscous friction,
                  energy used to irreversibly raise the centre of mass
                  through mixing, and changes in $E_p$ due to changes
                  in the background state. Note that \[ E_p = g
                  \int_{\bar{\rho}}^{\rho} (z - z^*) ds \] For a
                  closed system the energy equation is equivalent to
                  that of Winters et al 1995 if $\bar{\rho}$ is chosen
                  to be the adiabatic restratification of $\rho$, and
                  $E_p$ is the APE as it is commonly known.  The
                  mixing terms are globally negative, but locally can
                  have either sign.  \\Their energy equation does not
                  depend on the assumption that $\bar{\rho}$ is an
                  adiabatic restratification of $\rho$. In an open
                  system, determining the exact $\bar{\rho}$ is
                  difficult or impossible (much like Winters et al
                  1995 state), but they state: ``as long as conditions
                  within the domain allow the existence of an
                  equilibrium state ($\vec{u} = 0, \rho =
                  \bar{\rho}(z)$), one can guess a reasonable value
                  for $\bar{\rho}$, and calculate the resulting
                  fluxes." They then proceed to trash Chang et al 2006
                  for being so dumb by dropping the nonlinear flux
                  terms.  \\ The methods are applied to many (tidally
                  generated) packets of IWs. They determine
                  $\bar{\rho}$ from data taken just before arrival of
                  the waves. Equipartition is better at B than C,
                  because C is shallower. They do like Moum and Smyth
                  2006 and evaluate the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic
                  pressure terms.  \\ They also evaluate high and low
                  passed fluxes, and find that even though the high
                  pass flux is nonzero for about 15\% of the tidal
                  cycle, it accounts for 60\% of the total flux
                  averaged over the cycle.  \\ They estimate
                  dissipation for high and low pass fluxes by
                  considering the differences between stations B and
                  C, and find that dissipation is only 2.6 times
                  greater as a result of the waves.},

  abstract={Shoaling solitary internal waves are ubiquitous features
                  in the coastal regions of the world's oceans where
                  waves with a core of recirculating fluid (trapped
                  cores) can provide an effective transport
                  mechanism. Here, numerical evidence is presented
                  which suggests that there is a close connection
                  between the limiting behaviour of large-amplitude
                  solitary waves and the formation of such waves via
                  shoaling. For some background states,
                  large-amplitude waves are broad, having a nearly
                  horizontal flow in their centre. The flow in the
                  centre of such waves is called a conjugate flow. For
                  other background states, large-amplitude waves can
                  reach the breaking limit, at which the maximum
                  current in the wave is equal to the wave's
                  propagation speed. The presence of a background
                  current with near-surface vorticity of the same sign
                  as that induced by the wave can change the limiting
                  behaviour from the conjugate-flow limit to the
                  breaking limit. Numerical evidence is presented here
                  which suggests that if large solitary waves cannot
                  reach the breaking limit in the shallow water, that
                  is if the background flow has a conjugate flow, then
                  waves with trapped cores will not be formed via
                  shoaling. It is also shown that, due to a change in
                  the limiting behaviour of large waves, an
                  appropriate background current can enable the
                  formation of waves with trapped cores in
                  stratifications for which such waves are not formed
                  in the absence of a background current.},
  annote={An extension of the numerical experiments in Lamb 2002,
                  extended to look at oceanographically relevant
                  stratifications (i.e. tanh profiles), and including
                  background current shear near the surface. In Lamb
                  2002 he found that trapped cores would not form when
                  there was a surface mixed layer, and the maximum
                  amplitude of the waves was governed by the conjugate
                  flow limit ($U_{max} < c$). In the intro he states
                  \\ \emph{``The reason for the significant difference
                  in the limiting behavior of large waves ... is that
                  in the mixed layer there is no mechanism for the
                  generation of vorticity."}  \\This suggests however,
                  that a surface current with vorticity in the same
                  direction can enable the formation of trapped cores
                  in a stratification that otherwise wouldn't support
                  it.  \\Lamb and Wan 1998 found that conjugate flows
                  with open streaklines (i.e. not trapped cores) exist
                  only when the centre of the pycnocline is greater
                  than a critical distance $r(d)$ from the upper (wave
                  of depression) or lower (waves of elevation) boundary
                  ($d$ is the pycnocline thickness).  \\The results
                  with no background current are summarized in figure
                  3, where trapped cores only form if $z_0$
                  (pycnocline depth) is greater than $r_u(d)$ for
                  various values of $d$. In all cases shoaling waves
                  steepen at the back and if of sufficient amplitude
                  they overturn. For conjugate flow limited waves
                  ($z_0 < r_u(d)$) a patch of surf formed at the rear
                  of the wave during overturning is left behind, and
                  waves with amplitudes larger than the limit flatten
                  out from the front (see figure 4a). If $z_0$ is
                  above $r_u(d)$ there is a persistent surf near the
                  rear, and for $z_0 > r_u(d)$ the closed density
                  contours fill more of the wave.  \\Adding a sheared
                  background current modifies the $r_u(d)$ curve
                  (figure 6), but it is still found that trapped cores
                  only form when $z_0 > r_u(d)$. Now however, $r_u(d)$
                  is generally lower than with no current, meaning
                  trapped cores can be formed for stratifications that
                  couldn't previously. In other words, as the
                  background shear increases, $r_u(d)$ decreases.
                  \\He closes by stating: \emph{``The numerical
                  calculation of conjugate flows for a specified
                  stratification and background current is
                  computationally very cheap and provides a simple
                  means to determine whether waves with trapped cores
                  can exist."} How true it is.},

  abstract={We examine the transmission of internal gravity waves
                  through a non-uniformly stratified fluid with
                  vertically varying background shear. To quantify
                  wave transmission we show that the appropriate
                  measure is the ratio of the flux of transmitted to
                  incident pseudoenergy, T. We derive an analytic
                  prediction of T for the transmission of waves
                  through a piecewise-linear shear flow in two
                  cases. In both, the fluid is unstratified over the
                  depth of the shear and uniformly stratified
                  elsewhere.  In one study, the density profile is
                  continuous. Such a basic state is unstable but with
                  vanishingly small growth rate as the bulk Richardson
                  number, Ri, becomes large. In the limit of an
                  infinitely large Richardson number (no shear), we
                  recover the tunnelling prediction of Sutherland and
                  Yewchuk (2004). In weak shear, incident waves can
                  transmit weakly, even if the phase speed matches the
                  flow speed within the shear layer (a critical
                  level).  However, no transmission occurs when the
                  phase speed of incident waves exactly matches the
                  flow speed on the opposite flank of the shear. In
                  strong shear, with Ri $\simeq$ 1, a transmission
                  peak occurs where the incident wavenumber and
                  frequency are close to, but different from, those
                  associated with unstable modes.  In a second study,
                  the background density profile is discontinuous and
                  representative of a well-mixed patch within a once
                  uniformly stratified fluid. In this case, no
                  transmission occurs for incident waves with phase
                  speed matching the speed of the flow within the
                  shear layer. However, a transmission spike occurs if
                  the incident waves are resonant with interfacial
                  waves that flank the shear.},

                  shear present. Essentially an extension of
                  Sutherland and Yewchuck (2004) which didn't include
                  shear. The addition of shear requires some stability
                  consideration, though they find the timescales for
                  instability are longer than those for wave
                  transmission through the barrier. Presence of shear
                  also requires consideration of ``Pseudoenergy"
                  instead of energy, due to interaction of the waves
                  and the flow. Pseudoenergy is conserved (it is
                  proportional to the action) and is given by the
                  energy multiplied by $\omega / \Omega$, where
                  $\Omega$ is the relative frequency given by
                  $\Omega(z) = \omega - kU(z)$. \emph{How does this
                  pseudoenergy relate to KE + APE??}  \\ {\bf More
                  notes:} The presence of shear means that tunneling
                  internal waves also have to contend with a critical
                  level (where the mean current is equal to the
                  horizontal wave speed, so that $\Omega(z) = 0$). As
                  long as the horizontal phase speed of the waves
                  matches the flow speed in the upper layer, there is
                  no transmission (obviously). If the critical level
                  occurs in the region where $N =0$ though, the waves
                  may transmit through it. The reason the waves can
                  cross the critical level is because they are
                  evanescent in the shear region, not wave-like. In
                  fact, they find nearly perfect transmission for $kL
                  \leq 2$ and $\omega \leq N_0$ if $Ri = 1$.
                  \\For the mixed $N^2$ barrier (when $N^2$ is
                  discontinuous), no waves are transmitted when $0 < c
                  < U_0$, however there is much more transmission
                  otherwise, as well as a strong transmission spike at
                  $\omega \leq N_0$ and $kL \simeq 2.4$. In other
                  words, the presence of density discontinuities
                  serves to enhance transmission when no critical
                  level is reached, but completely inhibits it
                  otherwise.},

  abstract={Velocity, temperature, and salinity profile surveying in
                  Monterey Submarine Canyon during spring tide reveals
                  an internal wave field almost an order of magnitude
                  more energetic than that in the open
                  ocean. Semidiurnal fluctuations and their harmonics
                  dominate, near-inertial motions are absent. The
                  ratio of horizontal kinetic to available potential
                  energy is less than one in much of the canyon,
                  inconsistent with hydrostatic internal waves. The
                  excess potential energy may be due to isopycnal
                  displacements induced by barotropic tide flow over
                  the sloping bottom. Removal of the expected
                  barotropic contribution raises the energy ratio to
                  2.04-2.10, in line with the semidiurnal internal
                  wave value of 2.13. Finescale shear and strain are
                  also elevated. Finescale parameterizations for
                  turbulent eddy diffusivities, which have proven
                  successful in the open ocean, underestimate
                  upper-canyon microstructure estimates of 100 $\times
                  10^4$ m$^2$ s$^{-1}$ by a factor of 30. Energy
                  fluxes and near-bottom velocities are strongly
                  steered by the sinuous canyon topography. A
                  vertically integrated influx of 5 kW m$^{-1}$ at the
                  mouth diminishes to $\pm$1 kW m$^{-1}$ toward the
                  shallow end of the canyon. Both sinks and sources of
                  internal wave energy are indicated by energy-flux
                  convergences and divergences along the canyon
                  axis. Along-axis energy-flux convergences are
                  consistent with microstructure dissipation rates
                  $\varepsilon$. The high diapycnal eddy diffusivities
                  may drive strong nutrient fluxes to enhance
                  bioproductivity.},
  annote={The authors examine the internal wave field in a submarine
                  canyon, using XCP-XCTD pairs, bottom mounted ADCPs,
                  and CTD time series. Canyons are often areas of
                  increased biological productivity, possibly due to
                  upwelling and subsequent upcanyon flow. Enhanced
                  turbulence from an enhanced internal wave field may
                  also contribute. Canyons may contribute to higher
                  turbulence through focusing of internal waves and
                  critical reflection off the bottom.  \\ Sampling
                  included across canyon transects, repeated four
                  times in 12h, an along canyon transect, and various
                  measurements on the submarine fan and slope. ADCPs
                  were mounted near the shallow end of the
                  canyon. Isopycnal displacement ($\xi$) was
                  calculated from XCTD/XCP data relative to averages
                  over the entire survey. Energy fluxes were then
                  determined from $\langle \tilde{u} \tilde{p}
                  \rangle$, where $\tilde{p}$ was calculated from the
                  survey averaged $N^2$ and isopycnal profiles
                  assuming a hydrostatic balance. They note that this
                  holds for frequencies $\omega \ll N$, and is
                  therefore appropriate for the mostly semidiurnal
                  fluctuations.  \\ They produce frequency spectra
                  from the ADCP. For $f < \omega < N$ it resembles the
                  GM1979 spectrum except for: there is no inertial
                  peak, a dominant semidiurnal peak, the presence of
                  M2 and K1 harmonics, and excess energy near $N$
                  (probably caused by instrument noise). They
                  calculate KE and APE along and across the canyon,
                  using \[ PE = \frac{\bar{N}^2 \langle \xi^2
                  \rangle}{2} \] but to remove the barotropic
                  component they subtract a linear fit for $\xi$ (with
                  zero at the surface) from the isopycnal
                  displacements (i.e. $\tilde{\xi} = \xi - \xi_z
                  z$). Not doing this can lead to KE/PE ratios that
                  are too low. There are a number of plots showing the
                  energy along and across the canyon, showing
                  baroclinic energies are elevated compared to
                  open-ocean values, especially toward the head of the
                  canyon.  \\They also estimate finescale shear and
                  strain variance, which they use for estimates of
                  turbulent diffusion using several different
                  parameterizations. They find they best
                  parameterization underestimates microstructure
                  measurements by a factor of 30, implying that
                  open-ocean parameterizations are not valid in the
                  canyon, and that turbulence there is produced in a
                  fundamentally different way (either through enhanced
                  wave-wave interactions, the departure from the GM
                  spectrum, or interaction with canyon topography).
                  \\They estimate flux magnitudes and direction,
                  finding that they are mostly oriented up-canyon, and
                  in some cases seem to be able to navigate bends with
                  little loss. They then combine the flux and
                  dissipation rate to see whether the loss of energy
                  goes to turbulence (using steady state and weak
                  advection assumptions) i.e.  \[ \frac{\Delta \langle
                  \tilde{u}\tilde{p} \rangle}{\Delta r} =
                  \varepsilon_p = \varepsilon(1+\gamma) \] where
                  $\gamma$ is the mixing efficiency. They find that
                  flux convergences are comparable to $\varepsilon_p$,
                  though it is not just simple upcanyon dissipation as
                  there must be sources and sinks to explain the
                  observed flux. This implies that if internal tide
                  generation is important in the canyon, that might
                  control turbulence rather than an internal wave
                  cascade.},

  abstract={Ocean mixing, which affects pollutant dispersal, marine
                  productivity and global climate, largely results
                  from the breaking of internal gravity
                  waves--disturbances propagating along the ocean's
                  internal stratification. A global map of
                  internal-wave dissipation would be useful in
                  improving climate models, but would require
                  knowledge of the sources of internal gravity waves
                  and their propagation. Towards this goal, I present
                  here computations of horizontal internal-wave
                  propagation from 60 historical moorings and relate
                  them to the source terms of internal waves as
                  computed previously. Analysis of the two most
                  energetic frequency ranges--near-inertial
                  frequencies and semidiurnal tidal
                  frequencies--reveals that the fluxes in both
                  frequency bands are of the order of 1 kW x m(-1)
                  (that is, 15-50\% of the energy input) and are
                  directed away from their respective source
                  regions. However, the energy flux due to
                  near-inertial waves is stronger in winter, whereas
                  the tidal fluxes are uniform throughout the
                  year. Both varieties of internal waves can thus
                  significantly affect the space-time distribution of
                  energy available for global mixing.},
  annote={Alford presents an attempt to map energy fluxes in the
                  internal wave field for the inertial and semidiurnal
                  bands. Previous studies (Munk and Wunsch 1998,
                  Wunsch 1998) have shown that the wind and tide input
                  enough power ($\sim$ 2 TW) to maintain abyssal
                  stratification, however, long range propagation of
                  energy will produce significant differences between
                  source and dissipation regions, which with perfect
                  knowledge of sources and horizontal flux is given by
                  $D({\bf x}) = S({\bf x}) - \nabla \cdot {\bf
                  F(x)}$. Here he uses historical data at 60 locations
                  to compute flux magnitudes and directions for near
                  inertial and tidal frequencies. Near inertial fluxes
                  are greater in winter, and are predominantly
                  directed equatorward, while M$_2$ fluxes radiate
                  away from known source regions and are steady
                  throughout the year. Alford estimates the
                  magnitudes of fluxes in some of the regions, and
                  determines that globally significant amounts of
                  energy are being transported across
                  basins. E.g. $\sim$ 12 GW of inertial energy
                  produced in the northern pacific propagates into the
                  south pacific where if dissipated uniformly would
                  yield a depth mean dissipation rate of 10$^{-10}$ W
                  kg$^{-1}$ (typical of background thermocline mixing
                  rates). Similarly, calculations near the west
                  pacific trench and Hawaiian ridge indicate that much
                  of the internal tidal energy leaves the source
                  region ($\sim$50\% and 30\% respectively).},

                  background and perturbation pressure fields, and
                  flux of kinetic energy. (Note that he points out

                  and Fringer 2005, 2006).  The total mechanical
                  energy equation is of the form: \[ \frac{d

                  \right|_{\xi_r}^{\xi_l}.  \] Lamb finds that both
                  equations are satisfied to less than 1\%, indicating
                  that using a linear energy equation
                  (i.e. considering only the pressure work terms in
                  the flux) is not appropriate for the bank edge
                  case. In fact, the $\langle up \rangle$ term accounts for only
                  $\sim$1/2 of the pseudoenergy flux. This is
                  consistent with other studies, in particular Moum et

  annote={In this paper, the authors assess the contributions to the
                  pressure field under a nonhydrostatic non-linear
                  internal wave. Their discussion focuses on near
                  bottom waves of elevation, though it could be
                  extended to waves of depression (which tend to be
                  near the surface), and they discuss some of the
                  issues involved in this in Section 9.3. The consider
                  the total pressure at a depth $z$ to be: \[ p = p_U
                  + p_{Wh} + \rho_0 g \eta_H + p_{nh} \] where \[ p_U
                  = \int_z^H (\rho_0 + \rho_U) g dz' \] is the
                  upstream (or ambient) pressure field (i.e. the
                  background), \[ p_{Wh} = \int_z^H \rho_{Wh} g dz' \]
                  is the pressure anomaly associated with the wave,
                  i.e. the internal hydrostatic pressure, \[ \rho_0 g
                  \eta_H \] is the pressure associated with surface
                  variations caused by convergences and divergences of
                  the IW induced surface currents, and \[ p_{nh} =
                  \rho_0 \int_z^H \frac{Dw}{Dt} dz' \] is the
                  nonhydrostatic pressure contribution result from
                  vertical accelerations of fluid caused by the wave.
                  In section 2.2 they use small amplitude wave theory
                  (i.e. KdV) to predict the form of bottom pressure
                  signals under waves of elevation. They find $p_{Wh}$
                  to be a positive $\mathrm{sech}^2$ profile, $\rho_0
                  g \eta_H$ to be a negative $\mathrm{sech}^2$, and
                  $p_{nh}$ to be proportional to the 2nd derivative of
                  $\mathrm{sech}^2$.  They use bottom lander data from
                  the Oregon coast (same data as Moum et al 2006) to
                  evaluate the 3 pressure perturbation terms for 4
                  sets of IW trains. Wave speed is estimated from the
                  phase speed of the first baroclinic mode from KdV
                  (and from the speed of fluid in the crest, though
                  this represents a lower bound). To calculate
                  $p_{nh}$ they determine each of the terms in \[
                  \frac{Dw}{Dt} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} +
                  u\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} + w\frac{\partial
                  w}{\partial z}.  \] To determine internal
                  hydrostatic pressure, they map density profiles
                  taken just before the arrival of the waves to
                  streamlines determined from ADCP data.  Surface
                  displacement is estimated by integrating surface
                  accelerations in $x$. They find maximum surface
                  displacements of $\sim$ 1 mm. ADCP beam spreading is
                  a major source of error for this, as they cannot
                  measure currents closer than 24m below the surface.
                  The pressure disturbance at the seafloor is
                  dominated by $p_{Wh}$ and is therefore positive
                  definite.  They point out that for near surface
                  waves of depression, the surface signature is much
                  larger, and because it is opposite to the internal
                  hydrostatic field, may actually balance it or at
                  least very much decrease the otherwise negative
                  seafloor pressure disturbance, making it hard to
                  detect at greater and greater depth.},

  annote={This paper is the butt end of criticism from Lamb 2007,
                  Scotti et al 2006, and Moum et al 2006, for not
                  including nonlinear self advection of energy in
                  their energy flux calculations. They first calculate
                  internal wave energy by computing spectra, and then
                  integrating the spectra over frequency bands of
                  interest (NLIW band, semidiurnal band, diurnal
                  band). To overcome the fact that 2 of their ADCPs
                  only covered the upper half of the water column,
                  they used normal mode analysis to compute vertically
                  integrated energies.  \\ They compute energy flux
                  two ways, \[ \vec{F} = \int \vec{C_g} E dz \] and \[
                  \vec{F} = \int <p' \vec{u}' dz \] $\vec{C_g}$ is
                  determined separately for the NLIWs (from some kind
                  of harmonic analysis?) and for the tides (from IW
                  dispersion relation and normal mode analysis). They
                  calculate $p'$ by \[ p' = p_{surf} + \int_z^0 \rho'
                  g dz \] where $\rho'$ is estimated from isopycnal
                  displacement determined from time integration of the
                  vertical velocity. Because of the large difference
                  in energy flux between 2 stations, they estimate
                  that dissipation is the cause, and calculated a
                  kinetic energy dissipation rate as \[ \varepsilon =
                  \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta s} \] To get this they take
                  the energy equation \[ \frac{\partial E}{\partial t}
                  + ( \vec{u} \cdot \nabla) E = \nabla \cdot \vec{F} -
                  \varepsilon \] and assume $\frac{\partial
                  E}{\partial t}$ and $(\vec{u} \dot \nabla) E$ are
                  small. For NLIWs this clearly is no good as the
                  previously mention critiquing papers show that the
                  self advection can account for $\sim$50\% of the
                  energy flux.},

                  in density stratified flow. The goal is to separate
                  adiabatic processes from diabatic ones, so as to
                  evaluate changes in APE separately from changes in
                  BPE (background PE) and total PE. The model includes
                  dissipation and diffusion, and highlights that the
                  distinction between buoyancy flux ($-g\overline{\rho
                  w}$) and diabatic mixing. Definitions are: \[ E_p =
                  g \int_V \rho z dV \] is the total PE, \[ E_b = g
                  \int_V \rho z_*({\bf x},t) dV \] is the background
                  PE, where $z_*({\bf x},t)$ is the vertical position
                  of a fluid parcel originally at height $z$ after
                  redistributing the density field. The APE is
                  therefore \[ E_a = g \int_V \rho (z - z_*) dV \] as
                  $E_p = E_a + E_b$.  They show through a numerical
                  simulation of KH instability the temporal evolution
                  of $E_p$, $E_a$ and $E_b$ where the creation of
                  $E_a$ through adiabatic redistribution of the fluid
                  is subsequently removed through diabatic processes
                  (dissipation and diffusion) to increase $E_b$ until
                  after a long time $E_p$ and $E_b$ are the same (see
                  Figure 4).  They also have a nice figure showing a
                  schematic of exchange of energy between kinetic,
                  APE, BPE, and internal and external energy, and the
                  associated terms and equations that produce those
                  exchanges.  Section 6 discusses the numerical
                  implementation of calculating the APE and BPE
                  components, particularly with regards to the
                  necessary adiabatic redistribution of the density
                  field in order to determine the reference density
                  (i.e. the minimum potential energy state). A
                  computed background density will only be an
                  approximation of the true reference state, as each
                  horizontal layer of the sorted field may contain
                  difference density elements, which of course is not
                  the case for the true background field. They state
                  that as long as the rms fluid displacements exceed
                  the vertical grid spacing, the error in the computed
                  APE is insignificant. When the fluid displacements
                  were small wrt the grid spacing, interpolation of
                  the density field was required before the sorting
                  procedure converged to the background profile.
                  Overall, a nice clear oceanographic review of
                  APE. I'm not sure how this relates exactly to
                  Shepherd 1993, but it is at least more accessible.

                  determining Thorpe scales from ship-lowered CTD
                  profiles. The authors address several important
                  issues, including: the need to identify and correct
                  ship effects, optimizing the calculation of density
                  - necessary because of salinity spiking and thermal
                  lag effects arising from sensor limitations, and
                  validation of overturn identification - both due to
                  random noise and residual sensor effects. The
                  authors compare heavily against Galbraith and Kelley
                  1996, whose criteria they found did not work
                  adequately enough for their data set. In particular,
                  they believe that a diagnostic based on measurement
                  of tightness with the T-S relationship (such as that
                  used by GK96( is not warranted, and therefore not
                  recommended. Applying techniques such as this to
                  much of the world CTD profiles, however, could begin
                  to produce an interesting database of mixing and
                  turbulence measurements, without the use of
                  microstructure profilers.}

                  interfacial waves, and a mechanism termed ``local

                  internal tidal beam at the shelf break which
                  re-emerges at the surface some distance away,

                  streaks in the St. Lawrence Estuary, near the

                  aerial survey photographs taken about 3.5 hours
                  after low tide just off of Isle Verte. The bands are
                  clearly from a train of nonlinear internal waves,
                  though there is no in situ data to accompany the
                  photographs. Hydrographic and current data taken
                  during the same phase of the tide but two years
                  later do reveal nonlinear internal waves passing an
                  anchored ship. The generation mechanism is not
                  believed to be topographic, but consistent to the
                  theory of Lee and Beardsley (1974) and related to

                  on a 19 m deep shallow shelf of the East China

                  0.4\&\#8211;0.5) reported for oceanic stratified
                  turbulence in the pycnocline, which is associated
                  with relatively low local Reynolds numbers
                  R\&\#955;w. The scaling exponents \&\#958;(2) of the
                  second-order TSF, relative to the third-order
                  structure function, was also found to be a
                  decreasing function of R\&\#955;w, approaching the
                  classical value of 2/3 only at very high
                  R\&\#955;w. A larger departure from the universal
                  turbulent regime at lower Reynolds numbers could be
                  attributed to the higher anisotropy and associated
                  intermittency of underdeveloped turbulence.",

@article{Orton+al:2010,
    abstract = {{Estuarine near-surface turbulence is important for
                  transport, mixing, and air-water exchanges of many
                  important constituents but has rarely been studied
                  in detail. Here, we analyze a unique set of
                  estuarine observations of in situ atmospheric and
                  full water column measurements, estimated air-sea
                  exchanges, and acoustic measurements of several
                  terms in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)
                  budget. Observations from a 5.1 m deep site in the
                  Hudson River estuary include dissipation at 50 cm
                  depth (50), as well as profiles of TKE, shear
                  production of TKE (P), and net turbulent vertical
                  TKE transport (TD). Regressions suggest that the
                  principal controlling factor for 50 was wind
                  (through the surface shear velocity, U*) and that
                  the surface heat flux and tidal currents played a
                  secondary role. For ebb spring tides, the TKE budget
                  at 50 cm depth was closed within noise levels. Ebbs
                  had high 50 due to local shear production, which
                  nearly balanced 50. Floods had TD approaching P in
                  the upper water column but generally weak
                  near-surface shear and turbulence. Examining
                  buoyancy fluxes that impact near-surface
                  stratification and can indirectly control
                  turbulence, solar heat input and tidal straining
                  caused similar buoyancy fluxes on a sunny, calm
                  weather day, promoting ebb tide
                  restratification. Wind-driven mixing was found to
                  dominate during a fall season storm event, and
                  strong overnight heat loss after the storm helped
                  delay restratification afterward. These results
                  demonstrate the utility of combining detailed
                  air-sea interaction and physical oceanographic
                  measurements in future estuary studies.  }},

    abstract = {{Internal waves of depression were observed
                  propagating along-shelf and into northern Monterey
                  Bay, California (CA) on the inner shelf. These waves
                  had amplitudes approximately equal to the
                  thermocline depth (∼4 m), and were unstable to shear
                  and mix the thermocline. Isopycnal gradient spectra
                  showed that the wave packets lead to an elevated
                  mean dissipation rate of = 2.63 × 10−5 m3 s−2 for up
                  to 2 hours after wave passage. The proximity to the
                  surface created strong surface convergences that can
                  actively transport buoyant material, such as
                  plankton, back into the bay. The wave packets were
                  observed regularly over the upwelling season across
                  multiple years suggesting they may have large
                  effects on the documented spatial variation of
                  phytoplankton and larvae on the inner shelf. The
                  timing of the waves suggests they are not formed by
                  tides interacting with bathymetry, but are generated
                  by buoyant plume propagation.  }},

                  Jersey are used to describe the nonlinear internal
                  wave (NLIW) field and the background oceanographic
                  conditions that formed the waveguide on the
                  shelf. The subinertial, inertial, and tidal
                  circulation are described in detail, and the
                  background fluid state is characterized using the
                  coefficients of the extended Korteweg–de Vries
                  equation. The utility of this type of analysis is
                  demonstrated in description of an amplitude-limited,
                  flat wave. NLIWs observed over most of the month had
                  typical displacements of −8 m, but waves observed
                  from 17–21 August were almost twice as large with
                  displacements near −15 m. During most of the month,
                  wave packets occurred irregularly at a fixed
                  location, and often more than one packet was
                  observed per M2 tidal period. In contrast, the
                  arrival times of the large-amplitude wave groups
                  observed over 17–21 August were more closely phased
                  with the barotropic tide. The time span in which the
                  largest NLIWs were observed corresponded to neap
                  barotropic conditions, but when the shoreward
                  baroclinic energy flux was elevated. During the time
                  of large NLIWs, near-inertial waves were a dominate
                  contributor to the internal motions on the shelf and
                  apparently regulated wave formation, as
                  destructive/constructive modulation of the M2
                  internal tide by the inertial wavefield at the shelf
                  break corresponded to stronger/weaker NLIWs on the

    abstract = {In the early 1980s, in situ observations were made of
                  the spatial-temporal variability of the density
                  field at three separate shelf edge sites off the
                  Canadian east coast to improve our understanding of
                  the dynamics of the generation, transformation, and
                  dissipation of internal wave energy through an
                  analysis of the potential energy budget in the water
                  column. A description of the procedure for
                  estimating the perturbation potential energy and its
                  principal characteristics is given within a
                  conceptual framework, where an internal tide is
                  generated, propagates shoreward from the shelf edge,
                  is transformed by nonlinear effects into shorter
                  undulations such as solitary waves and internal
                  bores, and eventually dissipates. On the basis of
                  observations we find that the linear approximation
                  of the potential energy is a major fraction of
                  available potential energy, especially in
                  large-amplitude internal waves. The potential energy
                  in the generated internal tide is shown to covary
                  with the squared current volume flux in the
                  generating region. Turbulence and mixing are
                  expected to occur as the short, energetic waves
                  become unstable. From the observations, the rate of
                  energy dissipation is smallest on the Grand Bank
                  (0.007 W m−2 over a 30 km distance). In the Scotian
                  Gulf the loss rate is 0.05 W m−2 over a 13 km
                  distance. At The Gully site, where the energy
                  concentrations are the largest, dissipation is
                  estimated to be as large as 0.2 W m−2 over a 10 km
                  distance.  },

    abstract = {An acoustic Doppler current profiler was deployed
                  through land-fast ice near Resolute, Northwest
                  Territories. It recorded a distinct train of
                  high-frequency (periods < 20.0 min) internal waves
                  lasting 10 hours. Assuming linear dynamics, a modal
                  decomposition of the three velocity channels led to
                  the modal pressure anomaly taking a role analogous
                  to that of the surface displacement sensed by a
                  surface following heave, pitch, and roll
                  buoy. Partitioning the data into frequency dependent
                  cross-spectral matrices of the modal horizontal
                  pressure anomaly enabled the computation of
                  high-resolution, data-adaptive directional spectra,
                  recently presented for use with surface gravity
                  waves. The mode 1 directional spectra were
                  particularly sharp and indicated a cross-channel
                  point of origin of the waves to the northeast of the
                  study site. The lowest two frequency bands contained
                  considerable spectral power density that could not
                  be accurately described by the modal
                  decomposition. A direct examination of the

    abstract = {It is now accepted that double-diffusive processes
                  play a part in the mixing of heat and salt in the
                  ocean and that relevant information about them can
                  be obtained from laboratory experiments. There is
                  still a considerable gap, however, between the
                  laboratory work and the conditions under which the
                  phenomena occur in the ocean. Most of the laboratory
                  experiments have been one dimensional, whereas in
                  the ocean, strong double-diffusive layering is often
                  associated with large horizontal gradients of T and
                  S, especially where water with one set of T-S
                  properties intrudes at its own density level into an
                  environment with different properties. The main
                  purpose of the present paper is to report a series
                  of laboratory experiments which are related to the
                  latter case. The sugar-salt system and shadowgraph
                  photography have been used to explore various
                  situations of increasing complexity. The
                  double-diffusive effects are compared with the
                  behavior of a simple source of salt solution, which
                  intrudes horizontally as a thin layer into a
                  salinity gradient at its own density level. In
                  strong contrast to this a source of sugar in the
                  same salinity gradient produces vigorous vertical
                  convection near the source, followed by spreading at
                  several levels. The extending fluid moves out at an
                  angle to the horizontal, rising or falling across
                  isopycnals in a manner which can be related to the
                  composition of the environment and source fluids and
                  the double-diffusive transports across the
                  boundaries of the intrusions. When the ambient fluid
                  is set up with opposing gradients, so that potential
                  energy is stored in one of the components, there is
                  a more rapid spreading both horizontally and
                  vertically, and strong shears are produced. The
                  laboratory results are compared with published
                  oceanic data to suggest explanations of some
                  existing observations and to predict what might be
                  measurable in future work.  },

    abstract = {A novel aerial observational method for studying
                  internal features in the coastal ocean is developed
                  and tested in a study of large nonlinear internal
                  solitary-like waves. Photogrammetrically rectified
                  oblique photo images from a circling aircraft are
                  used to track a number of internal wave packets for
                  periods of up to one hour in the Strait of Georgia,
                  British Columbia, Canada. Combining these sequences
                  with coincident water column data allows us to
                  obtain a more complete view of the spatial structure
                  of internal waves. Highly accurate measurements of
                  wave propagation speeds and directions are
                  possible. The applicability of various weakly
                  nonlinear theories in modeling propagation of the
                  observed large-amplitude waves is tested. The
                  measured wave speeds enable us to differentiate
                  between classic internal wave models. The linear,
                  KdV (Korteweg-de Vries), and BO (Benjamin-Ono)
                  models are applied with and without background
                  shear. After background shear effects are included,
                  it is found that a continuously stratified BO
                  equation can predict propagation speeds within
                  observational error, and that this is not true for
                  other theories. The technique may be useful in
                  future studies of oblique internal wave

                  via open ocean guyots to a 1900 m deep Gulf of
                  Mexico. All sites show more or less sloping bottom
                  topography. Focusing on frequencies ($\sigma$)
                  higher than tidal, the pressure records are
                  remarkably similar, to within the 95\% statistical
                  significance bounds, in the internal gravity wave
                  continuum (IWC) band up to buoyancy frequency N. The
                  IWC has a relatively uniform spectral slope:
                  $\log(P(\sigma)) = -\alpha log(\sigma),
                  \alpha; = 2 \pm 1/3$. The spectral collapse is
                  confirmed from independent internal hydrostatic
                  pressure estimate, which suggests a saturated
                  IWC. For $\sigma \gt$ N, all pressure-spectra
                  transit to a bulge that differs in magnitude. This
                  bulge is commonly attributed to long surface
                  waves. For the present data it is suggested to be
                  due to stratified turbulence-internal wave
                  coupling, which is typically large over sloping
                  topography. The bulge drops off at a more or less
                  common frequency of 2-3 $\times 10^{-2}$ Hz,
                  which is probably related with typical turbulent

    abstract = {The Eastern Mediterranean Sea contains relatively
                  small trenches O(1-10 km) horizontal width that go
                  deeper than 4000 m. At a first glance, these deep
                  waters are homogeneous, with weak currents $\lt$
                  0.1m s$^{-1}$. This viewpoint is modified after
                  evaluation of new detailed yearlong temperature
                  observations using 103 high-precision sensors that
                  reveal intense variability of internal waves. Even
                  though temperature variations are within the range
                  of a few mK only, requiring precise correction for
                  the adiabatic lapse rate during post-processing, the
                  images are permanently dynamic. The weak density
                  stratification of buoyancy close to the inertial
                  frequency supports large turbulent overturns
                  indirectly governed or advected by large internal
                  waves. In strongly stratified (near-surface) waters
                  low-frequency inertial internal motions are
                  horizontal, but here they attain a vertical current
                  amplitude sometimes comparable to horizontal
                  currents. This results in occasionally very large
                  internal wave amplitudes (250 m peak-trough), which
                  are generated via geostrophic adjustment presumably
                  from local collapse of fronts.},

@article{Cyr+al:2011,
    abstract = {The relative importance of interior versus boundary
                  mixing is examined for the erosion of the cold
                  intermediate layer (CIL) of the Gulf of
                  St. Lawrence. Based on 18 years of historical
                  temperature profiles, the seasonal erosion of the
                  core temperature, thickness and heat content of the
                  CIL are, respectively, ${\dot T}_{min} = 0.24 \pm
                  0.04^{\circ}$C mo$^{-1}$, ${\dot d}_{min} = -11 \pm
                  2$ m mo$^{-1}$ and ${\dot H} = 0.59 \pm 0.09$ MJ
                  m$^{-3}$ mo$^{-1}$. These erosion rates are
                  remarkably well reproduced with a one-dimensional
                  vertical diffusion model fed with turbulent
                  diffusivities inferred from 892 microstructure
                  casts. This suggests that the CIL is principally
                  eroded by vertical diffusion processes. The CIL
                  erosion is best reproduced by mean turbulent kinetic
                  energy dissipation rate and eddy diffusivity
                  coefficient of $\epsilon \simeq 2 \times 10^{-8}$ W
                  kg$^{-1}$ and $K \simeq 4 \times 10^{-5}$ m$^2$
                  s$^{-1}$, respectively. It is also suggested that
                  while boundary mixing may be significant it may not
                  dominate CIL erosion. Interior mixing alone accounts
                  for about 70\% of this diffusivity with the
                  remainder being attributed to boundary mixing. The
                  latter result is in accordance with recent studies
                  that suggest that boundary mixing is not the
                  principal mixing agent in coastal seas.},

@article{Sumer+al:2011,
	Abstract = {Two parallel experiments involving the evolution
                  and runup of plunging solitary waves on a sloping
                  bed were conducted: (1) a rigid-bed experiment,
                  allowing direct (hot film) measurements of bed shear
                  stresses and (2) a sediment-bed experiment, allowing
                  for the measurement of pore water pressures and for
                  observation of the morphological changes. The two
                  experimental conditions were kept as similar as
                  possible. The experiments showed that the complete
                  sequence of the plunging solitary wave involves the
                  following processes: shoaling and wave breaking;
                  runup; rundown and hydraulic jump; and trailing
                  wave. The bed shear stress measurements showed that
                  the mean bed shear stress increases tremendously
                  (with respect to that in the approaching wave
                  boundary layer), by as much as a factor of 8, in the
                  runup and rundown stages, and that the RMS value of
                  the fluctuating component of the bed shear stress is
                  also affected, by as much as a factor of 2, in the
                  runup and hydraulic jump stages. The pore water
                  pressure measurements showed that the sediment at
                  (or near) the surface of the bed experiences upward
                  directed pressure gradient forces during the
                  down-rush phase. The magnitude of this force can
                  reach values as much as approximately 30{\%} of the
                  submerged weight of the sediment. The experiments
                  further showed that the sediment transport occurs in
                  the sheet flow regime for a substantial portion of
                  the beach covering the area where the entire
                  sequence of the wave breaking takes place. The bed
                  morphology is explained qualitatively in terms of
                  the measured bed shear stress and the pressure
                  gradient forces.},
