  volume = {423},
  pages = {159--62},
  number = {6936},
  abstract = {Ocean mixing, which affects pollutant dispersal, marine productivity
	and global climate, largely results from the breaking of internal
	gravity waves--disturbances propagating along the ocean's internal
	stratification. A global map of internal-wave dissipation would be
	useful in improving climate models, but would require knowledge of
	the sources of internal gravity waves and their propagation. Towards
	this goal, I present here computations of horizontal internal-wave
	propagation from 60 historical moorings and relate them to the source
	terms of internal waves as computed previously. Analysis of the two
	most energetic frequency ranges--near-inertial frequencies and semidiurnal
	tidal frequencies--reveals that the fluxes in both frequency bands
	are of the order of 1 kW x m(-1) (that is, 15-50\% of the energy
	input) and are directed away from their respective source regions.
	However, the energy flux due to near-inertial waves is stronger in
	winter, whereas the tidal fluxes are uniform throughout the year.
	Both varieties of internal waves can thus significantly affect the
	space-time distribution of energy available for global mixing.},
  annote = {Alford presents an attempt to map energy fluxes in the internal wave
	field for the inertial and semidiurnal bands. Previous studies (Munk
	and Wunsch 1998, Wunsch 1998) have shown that the wind and tide input
	enough power ($\sim$ 2 TW) to maintain abyssal stratification, however,
	long range propagation of energy will produce significant differences
	between source and dissipation regions, which with perfect knowledge
	of sources and horizontal flux is given by $D({\bf x}) = S({\bf x})
	- \nabla \cdot {\bf F(x)}$. Here he uses historical data at 60 locations
	to compute flux magnitudes and directions for near inertial and tidal
	frequencies. Near inertial fluxes are greater in winter, and are
	predominantly directed equatorward, while M$_2$ fluxes radiate away
	from known source regions and are steady throughout the year. Alford
	estimates the magnitudes of fluxes in some of the regions, and determines
	that globally significant amounts of energy are being transported
	across basins. E.g. $\sim$ 12 GW of inertial energy produced in the
	northern pacific propagates into the south pacific where if dissipated
	uniformly would yield a depth mean dissipation rate of 10$^{-10}$
	W kg$^{-1}$ (typical of background thermocline mixing rates). Similarly,
	calculations near the west pacific trench and Hawaiian ridge indicate
	that much of the internal tidal energy leaves the source region ($\sim$50\%
	and 30\% respectively).},

  abstract = {We examine the transmission of internal gravity waves through a non-uniformly
	stratified fluid with vertically varying background shear. To quantify
	wave transmission we show that the appropriate measure is the ratio
	of the flux of transmitted to incident pseudoenergy, T. We derive
	an analytic prediction of T for the transmission of waves through
	a piecewise-linear shear flow in two cases. In both, the fluid is
	unstratified over the depth of the shear and uniformly stratified
	elsewhere. In one study, the density profile is continuous. Such
	a basic state is unstable but with vanishingly small growth rate
	as the bulk Richardson number, Ri, becomes large. In the limit of
	an infinitely large Richardson number (no shear), we recover the
	tunnelling prediction of Sutherland and Yewchuk (2004). In weak shear,
	incident waves can transmit weakly, even if the phase speed matches
	the flow speed within the shear layer (a critical level). However,
	no transmission occurs when the phase speed of incident waves exactly
	matches the flow speed on the opposite flank of the shear. In strong
	shear, with Ri $\simeq$ 1, a transmission peak occurs where the incident
	wavenumber and frequency are close to, but different from, those
	associated with unstable modes. In a second study, the background
	density profile is discontinuous and representative of a well-mixed
	patch within a once uniformly stratified fluid. In this case, no
	transmission occurs for incident waves with phase speed matching
	the speed of the flow within the shear layer. However, a transmission
	spike occurs if the incident waves are resonant with interfacial
	waves that flank the shear.},
  annote = {They examine the transmission of IWs through an ``$N^2$ barrier"
	and a ``mixed $N^2$ region when there is shear present. Essentially
	an extension of Sutherland and Yewchuck (2004) which didn't include
	shear. The addition of shear requires some stability consideration,
	though they find the timescales for instability are longer than those
	for wave transmission through the barrier. Presence of shear also
	requires consideration of ``Pseudoenergy" instead of energy, due
	to interaction of the waves and the flow. Pseudoenergy is conserved
	(it is proportional to the action) and is given by the energy multiplied
	by $\omega / \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the relative frequency given
	by $\Omega(z) = \omega - kU(z)$. \emph{How does this pseudoenergy
	relate to KE + APE??} \\ {\bf More notes:} The presence of shear
	means that tunneling internal waves also have to contend with a critical
	level (where the mean current is equal to the horizontal wave speed,
	so that $\Omega(z) = 0$). As long as the horizontal phase speed of
	the waves matches the flow speed in the upper layer, there is no
	transmission (obviously). If the critical level occurs in the region
	where $N =0$ though, the waves may transmit through it. The reason
	the waves can cross the critical level is because they are evanescent
	in the shear region, not wave-like. In fact, they find nearly perfect
	transmission for $kL \leq 2$ and $\omega \leq N_0$ if $Ri = 1$. \\For
	the mixed $N^2$ barrier (when $N^2$ is discontinuous), no waves are
	transmitted when $0 < c < U_0$, however there is much more transmission
	otherwise, as well as a strong transmission spike at $\omega \leq
	N_0$ and $kL \simeq 2.4$. In other words, the presence of density
	discontinuities serves to enhance transmission when no critical level
	is reached, but completely inhibits it otherwise.},

  annote = {This paper is the butt end of criticism from Lamb 2007, Scotti et

	of energy in their energy flux calculations. They first calculate
	internal wave energy by computing spectra, and then integrating the
	spectra over frequency bands of interest (NLIW band, semidiurnal
	band, diurnal band). To overcome the fact that 2 of their ADCPs only
	covered the upper half of the water column, they used normal mode
	analysis to compute vertically integrated energies. \\ They compute
	energy flux two ways, \[ \vec{F} = \int \vec{C_g} E dz \] and \[
	\vec{F} = \int <p' \vec{u}' dz \] $\vec{C_g}$ is determined separately
	for the NLIWs (from some kind of harmonic analysis?) and for the
	tides (from IW dispersion relation and normal mode analysis). They
	calculate $p'$ by \[ p' = p_{surf} + \int_z^0 \rho' g dz \] where
	$\rho'$ is estimated from isopycnal displacement determined from
	time integration of the vertical velocity. Because of the large difference
	in energy flux between 2 stations, they estimate that dissipation
	is the cause, and calculated a kinetic energy dissipation rate as
	\[ \varepsilon = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta s} \] To get this they take
	the energy equation \[ \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + ( \vec{u}
	\cdot \nabla) E = \nabla \cdot \vec{F} - \varepsilon \] and assume
	$\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$ and $(\vec{u} \dot \nabla) E$ are
	small. For NLIWs this clearly is no good as the previously mention
	critiquing papers show that the self advection can account for $\sim$50\%
	of the energy flux.}

  annote = {A good review of ISWs highlighting: theoretical models, lab experiments,
	generation, evolution, and dissipation. \\ Models: Focuses mostly
	on the extended KdV (eKdV) as a weakly nonlinear model, which includes
	a cubic nonlinearity term (Djordjevic and Redekopp 1978) \[ \eta_t
	+ (c_0 + \alpha_1 \eta + \alpha_2 \eta^2) \eta_x + \beta_1 \eta_{xxx}
	= 0 \] which has a solitary wave solution \[ \eta = \frac{\eta_0}{b
	+ (1-b)\mathrm{cosh}^2 \gamma (x-ct)} \] which reduces to the familiar
	sech$^2$ when $\alpha_2=0$. Large amplitude models include MCC (which
	agrees with eKdV for $0.4 < \frac{h_1}{h_1 + h_2} < 0.6$). Also discussed
	is the theory of Ostrovsky and Grue 2003, which does not suffer from
	KH instability of large amplitude waves like MCC. The equation is
	the phenomenological derivation of KdV \[ \eta_t + c(\eta)\eta_x
	+ (\beta (\eta) \eta_{xx})_x = 0 \] where $c(\eta)$ is the exact
	nonlinear speed from nondispersive theory. Also discuss various authors
	that consider fully nonlinear models (e.g. see Lamb 2002/2003, Turkington
	1991). \\Then they summarize various lab experiments. \\Wave generation
	by tides (Halpern 1971): initial generation of a front upstream due
	to ``blocking" by topography, nonlinear steepening of the front,
	then generation of a wave packet by the combined effects of nonlinearity
	and dispersion. Also discuss Knight Inlet where the plunging thermocline
	causes the accelerating lower layer flow to become unstable to shear
	instabilities which may develop into ISWs. \\Evolution is governed
	by changes in topography and stratification, and rotation. In particular
	they note the recently detected waves of elevation (Klymak and Moum
	2003, etc) which often show transitions from waves of depression
	to elevation (e.g. South China Sea). The effect of rotation generally
	is to damp solitary wave solutions, often through radiation of Poincare
	waves. They discussion dissipation due to its importance for transport
	and mixing. Methods of dissipation are: radiation damping (NLIWs
	propagating over a weakly stratified lower layer may radiate internal
	waves into it), boundary shear (e.g. bottom boundary shear/turbulence/dissipation),
	shear instability ($Ri < 1/4$ can produce thickening of the interface
	- i.e. greater PE at the expense of the ISWs, most likely caused
	by KH instability - see Moum et al 2003), and wave breaking. Breaking
	often occurs in the vicinity of the turning point ($h_1 = h_2$),
	and is followed by the formation of boluses. Lamb 2003 examined the
	idea of trapped cores. Mixing efficiency as a result of breaking
	is usually between 15-25 \%.},

  abstract = {Velocity, temperature, and salinity profile surveying in Monterey
	Submarine Canyon during spring tide reveals an internal wave field
	almost an order of magnitude more energetic than that in the open
	ocean. Semidiurnal fluctuations and their harmonics dominate, near-inertial
	motions are absent. The ratio of horizontal kinetic to available
	potential energy is less than one in much of the canyon, inconsistent
	with hydrostatic internal waves. The excess potential energy may
	be due to isopycnal displacements induced by barotropic tide flow
	over the sloping bottom. Removal of the expected barotropic contribution
	raises the energy ratio to 2.04-2.10, in line with the semidiurnal
	internal wave value of 2.13. Finescale shear and strain are also
	elevated. Finescale parameterizations for turbulent eddy diffusivities,
	which have proven successful in the open ocean, underestimate upper-canyon
	microstructure estimates of 100 $\times 10^4$ m$^2$ s$^{-1}$ by a
	factor of 30. Energy fluxes and near-bottom velocities are strongly
	steered by the sinuous canyon topography. A vertically integrated
	influx of 5 kW m$^{-1}$ at the mouth diminishes to $\pm$1 kW m$^{-1}$
	toward the shallow end of the canyon. Both sinks and sources of internal
	wave energy are indicated by energy-flux convergences and divergences
	along the canyon axis. Along-axis energy-flux convergences are consistent
	with microstructure dissipation rates $\varepsilon$. The high diapycnal
	eddy diffusivities may drive strong nutrient fluxes to enhance bioproductivity.},
  annote = {The authors examine the internal wave field in a submarine canyon,
	using XCP-XCTD pairs, bottom mounted ADCPs, and CTD time series.
	Canyons are often areas of increased biological productivity, possibly
	due to upwelling and subsequent upcanyon flow. Enhanced turbulence
	from an enhanced internal wave field may also contribute. Canyons
	may contribute to higher turbulence through focusing of internal
	waves and critical reflection off the bottom. \\ Sampling included
	across canyon transects, repeated four times in 12h, an along canyon
	transect, and various measurements on the submarine fan and slope.
	ADCPs were mounted near the shallow end of the canyon. Isopycnal
	displacement ($\xi$) was calculated from XCTD/XCP data relative to
	averages over the entire survey. Energy fluxes were then determined
	from $\langle \tilde{u} \tilde{p} \rangle$, where $\tilde{p}$ was
	calculated from the survey averaged $N^2$ and isopycnal profiles
	assuming a hydrostatic balance. They note that this holds for frequencies
	$\omega \ll N$, and is therefore appropriate for the mostly semidiurnal
	fluctuations. \\ They produce frequency spectra from the ADCP. For
	$f < \omega < N$ it resembles the GM1979 spectrum except for: there
	is no inertial peak, a dominant semidiurnal peak, the presence of
	M2 and K1 harmonics, and excess energy near $N$ (probably caused
	by instrument noise). They calculate KE and APE along and across
	the canyon, using \[ PE = \frac{\bar{N}^2 \langle \xi^2 \rangle}{2}
	\] but to remove the barotropic component they subtract a linear
	fit for $\xi$ (with zero at the surface) from the isopycnal displacements
	(i.e. $\tilde{\xi} = \xi - \xi_z z$). Not doing this can lead to
	KE/PE ratios that are too low. There are a number of plots showing
	the energy along and across the canyon, showing baroclinic energies
	are elevated compared to open-ocean values, especially toward the
	head of the canyon. \\They also estimate finescale shear and strain
	variance, which they use for estimates of turbulent diffusion using
	several different parameterizations. They find they best parameterization
	underestimates microstructure measurements by a factor of 30, implying
	that open-ocean parameterizations are not valid in the canyon, and
	that turbulence there is produced in a fundamentally different way
	(either through enhanced wave-wave interactions, the departure from
	the GM spectrum, or interaction with canyon topography). \\They estimate
	flux magnitudes and direction, finding that they are mostly oriented
	up-canyon, and in some cases seem to be able to navigate bends with
	little loss. They then combine the flux and dissipation rate to see
	whether the loss of energy goes to turbulence (using steady state
	and weak advection assumptions) i.e. \[ \frac{\Delta \langle \tilde{u}\tilde{p}
	\rangle}{\Delta r} = \varepsilon_p = \varepsilon(1+\gamma) \] where
	$\gamma$ is the mixing efficiency. They find that flux convergences
	are comparable to $\varepsilon_p$, though it is not just simple upcanyon
	dissipation as there must be sources and sinks to explain the observed
	flux. This implies that if internal tide generation is important
	in the canyon, that might control turbulence rather than an internal
	wave cascade.},

	while evaluating contributions from various flux terms, including:
	flux of background and perturbation potential energy, rate of work

	field may further be decomposed into hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic
	parts, following Moum et al 2006 and Venayagamoorthy and Fringer
	2005, 2006). The total mechanical energy equation is of the form:
	\[ \frac{d \bar{E}}{dt} = \left. \left[ (PE_{f1} + W_1) + PE_{f2}
	+ W_2 + K_f \right] \right|_{\xi_r}^{\xi_l} \] and the pseudoenergy

	+ W_2) \right|_{\xi_r}^{\xi_l}. \] Lamb finds that both equations
	are satisfied to less than 1\%, indicating that using a linear energy
	equation (i.e. considering only the pressure work terms in the flux)
	is not appropriate for the bank edge case. In fact, the $\langle
	up \rangle$ term accounts for only $\sim$1/2 of the pseudoenergy
	flux. This is consistent with other studies, in particular Moum et

	high frequency nonhydrostatic ISW field. },

  journal = {Journal of Fluid Mechanics},
  year = {2003},

  pages = {81--100},
  abstract = {Shoaling solitary internal waves are ubiquitous features in the coastal
	regions of the world's oceans where waves with a core of recirculating
	fluid (trapped cores) can provide an effective transport mechanism.
	Here, numerical evidence is presented which suggests that there is
	a close connection between the limiting behaviour of large-amplitude
	solitary waves and the formation of such waves via shoaling. For
	some background states, large-amplitude waves are broad, having a
	nearly horizontal flow in their centre. The flow in the centre of
	such waves is called a conjugate flow. For other background states,
	large-amplitude waves can reach the breaking limit, at which the
	maximum current in the wave is equal to the wave's propagation speed.
	The presence of a background current with near-surface vorticity
	of the same sign as that induced by the wave can change the limiting
	behaviour from the conjugate-flow limit to the breaking limit. Numerical
	evidence is presented here which suggests that if large solitary
	waves cannot reach the breaking limit in the shallow water, that
	is if the background flow has a conjugate flow, then waves with trapped
	cores will not be formed via shoaling. It is also shown that, due
	to a change in the limiting behaviour of large waves, an appropriate
	background current can enable the formation of waves with trapped
	cores in stratifications for which such waves are not formed in the
	absence of a background current.},
  annote = {An extension of the numerical experiments in Lamb 2002, extended
	to look at oceanographically relevant stratifications (i.e. tanh
	profiles), and including background current shear near the surface.
	In Lamb 2002 he found that trapped cores would not form when there
	was a surface mixed layer, and the maximum amplitude of the waves
	was governed by the conjugate flow limit ($U_{max} < c$). In the
	intro he states \\ \emph{``The reason for the significant difference
	in the limiting behavior of large waves ... is that in the mixed
	layer there is no mechanism for the generation of vorticity."} \\This
	suggests however, that a surface current with vorticity in the same
	direction can enable the formation of trapped cores in a stratification
	that otherwise wouldn't support it. \\Lamb and Wan 1998 found that
	conjugate flows with open streaklines (i.e. not trapped cores) exist
	only when the centre of the pycnocline is greater than a critical
	distance $r(d)$ from the upper (wave of depression) or lower (waves
	of elevation) boundary ($d$ is the pycnocline thickness). \\The results
	with no background current are summarized in figure 3, where trapped
	cores only form if $z_0$ (pycnocline depth) is greater than $r_u(d)$
	for various values of $d$. In all cases shoaling waves steepen at
	the back and if of sufficient amplitude they overturn. For conjugate
	flow limited waves ($z_0 < r_u(d)$) a patch of surf formed at the
	rear of the wave during overturning is left behind, and waves with
	amplitudes larger than the limit flatten out from the front (see
	figure 4a). If $z_0$ is above $r_u(d)$ there is a persistent surf
	near the rear, and for $z_0 > r_u(d)$ the closed density contours
	fill more of the wave. \\Adding a sheared background current modifies
	the $r_u(d)$ curve (figure 6), but it is still found that trapped
	cores only form when $z_0 > r_u(d)$. Now however, $r_u(d)$ is generally
	lower than with no current, meaning trapped cores can be formed for
	stratifications that couldn't previously. In other words, as the
	background shear increases, $r_u(d)$ decreases. \\He closes by stating:
	\emph{``The numerical calculation of conjugate flows for a specified
	stratification and background current is computationally very cheap
	and provides a simple means to determine whether waves with trapped
	cores can exist."} How true it is.},

  annote = {Lamb examines the formation of trapped cores for shoaling solitary
	waves of depression, with a variety of different stratifications,
	and shelf widths. He uses an exponential stratification (with 3 different
	scale heights of 15, 35, and 75 m), a tanh profile with scale heights
	of 20 and 45 m (making them similar to the exponential profiles),
	and a mixed-layer profile which is a modification of the S=15m exponential
	to include a 2 m thick surface mixed layer. There are 3 limits to
	wave amplitude that are of relevance. The breaking limit occurs when
	the maximum velocity in the wave ($U_{max}$) is equal to the wave
	speed $c$. At this point, a streamline in a reference frame moving
	with the wave, first becomes vertical. The conjugate flow limit occurs
	for waves that become flat in the centre and simply become longer
	as the amplitude increases (Benjamin 1966, Lamb and Wan 1998). Finally,
	the stability limit occurs when the minimum Richardson number near
	the wave goes below 0.25, though this is not a set in stone criterion,
	as the flow in a NLIW is not parallel. \\Note that a trapped core
	occurs when a wave core exhibits closed streamlines. Trapped cores
	are significant because they have the potential to transport fluid
	over large distances. \\ By comparing theoretical properties of waves
	for the exponential and mixed-layer stratifications, Lamb shows that
	the maximum wave currents in large solitary waves are sensitive to
	changes in the near-surface density. \\Numerical experiments illustrate
	many aspects of varying amplitude waves shoaling over the shelf for
	the indicated stratifications, and for 3 different shelf widths of
	200, 400, and 600 m. Structure of the trapped cores, evolution of
	wave amplitudes and velocities, and breaking depths are all elucidated
	with detailed figures. Some preliminary energetics calculations are
	also performed. \\ Results indicate that trapped cores can form after
	breaking for the exponential and tanh stratifications, but \emph{do
	not} occur for the mixed layer profile. While the maximum amplitude
	of the solitary waves after adjusting on the shallower shelf (and
	perhaps after having formed a trapped core) is usually governed by
	the breaking limit, the amplitude for waves in the mixed-layer case
	is instead governed by the conjugate flow limit. Breaking for trapped
	core forming waves can occur on the shelf, while for the mixed-layer
	it always occurs over the slope. These results imply that waves with
	trapped cores will not be formed in the ocean under most oceanographic
	conditions. \\ \\ \textbf{Some extra notes on limits for large amplitude
	waves:} \\ ISW amplitude is limited by one of 3 things: the breaking
	limit, the conjugate flow limit, and the stability limit. Different
	limits are important for different stratifications and configurations.
	\\ The breaking limit occurs when $U_{max} = c$, at which point overturning
	occurs and a trapped core may be formed. \\ For waves governed by
	the conjugate flow limit, $U_{max} < c$ and trapped cores are not
	formed, even if breaking occurs. Higher energy waves become broader
	instead of higher, and all streamlines are open.},

  abstract = {The higher-order structure functions of vertical velocity fluctuations
	(transverse structure functions (TSF)) were employed to study the
	characteristics of turbulence intermittency in a reversing tidal
	flow on a 19 m deep shallow shelf of the East China Sea. Measurements
	from a downward-looking, bottom-mounted Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter,
	positioned 0.45 m above the seafloor, which spanned two semidiurnal
	tidal cycles, were analyzed. A classical lognormal single-parameter
	(\&\#956;) model for intermittency and the universal multifractal
	approach (specifically, the two-parameter (C1 and \&\#945;) log-Levy
	model) were employed to analyze the TSF exponent \&\#958;(q) in tidally
	driven turbulent boundary layer and to estimate \&\#956;, C1, and
	\&\#945;. During the energetic flooding tidal phases, the parameters
	of intermittency models approached the mean values of \$\{{\backslash}widetilde\{{\backslash}mu\}\}\$
	\&\#8776; 0.24, \$\{{\backslash}widetilde\{C\}\}\$1 \&\#8776; 0.15,
	and \$\{{\backslash}widetilde\{{\backslash}alpha\}\}\$ \&\#8776;
	1.5, which are accepted as the universal values for fully developed
	turbulence at high Reynolds numbers. With the decrease of advection
	velocity, \&\#956; and C1 increased up to \&\#956; \&\#8776; 0.5\&\#8211;0.6
	and C1 \&\#8776; 0.25\&\#8211;0.35, but \&\#945; decreased to about
	1.4. The results explain the reported disparities between the smaller
	\&\#8220;universal\&\#8221; values of intermittency parameters \&\#956;
	and C1 (mostly measured in laboratory and atmospheric high Reynolds
	number flows) and those (\&\#956; = 0.4\&\#8211;0.5) reported for
	oceanic stratified turbulence in the pycnocline, which is associated
	with relatively low local Reynolds numbers R\&\#955;w. The scaling
	exponents \&\#958;(2) of the second-order TSF, relative to the third-order
	structure function, was also found to be a decreasing function of
	R\&\#955;w, approaching the classical value of 2/3 only at very high
	R\&\#955;w. A larger departure from the universal turbulent regime
	at lower Reynolds numbers could be attributed to the higher anisotropy
	and associated intermittency of underdeveloped turbulence.},

	train of high-frequency (periods < 20.0 min) internal waves lasting
	10 hours. Assuming linear dynamics, a modal decomposition of the
	three velocity channels led to the modal pressure anomaly taking
	a role analogous to that of the surface displacement sensed by a
	surface following heave, pitch, and roll buoy. Partitioning the data
	into frequency dependent cross-spectral matrices of the modal horizontal
	pressure anomaly enabled the computation of high-resolution, data-adaptive
	directional spectra, recently presented for use with surface gravity
	waves. The mode 1 directional spectra were particularly sharp and
	indicated a cross-channel point of origin of the waves to the northeast
	of the study site. The lowest two frequency bands contained considerable
	spectral power density that could not be accurately described by
	the modal decomposition. A direct examination of the cross-channel
	velocity time series indicated substantial low-frequency (periods
	> 30.0 min) horizontal flow without a corresponding coherent vertical
	velocity component, attributed to a density driven along-isopycnal
	flow created by salt rejection emanating from a broad shelf to the
	northeast. },

  annote = {In this paper, the authors assess the contributions to the pressure
	field under a nonhydrostatic non-linear internal wave. Their discussion
	focuses on near bottom waves of elevation, though it could be extended
	to waves of depression (which tend to be near the surface), and they
	discuss some of the issues involved in this in Section 9.3. The consider
	the total pressure at a depth $z$ to be: \[ p = p_U + p_{Wh} + \rho_0
	g \eta_H + p_{nh} \] where \[ p_U = \int_z^H (\rho_0 + \rho_U) g
	dz' \] is the upstream (or ambient) pressure field (i.e. the background),
	\[ p_{Wh} = \int_z^H \rho_{Wh} g dz' \] is the pressure anomaly associated
	with the wave, i.e. the internal hydrostatic pressure, \[ \rho_0
	g \eta_H \] is the pressure associated with surface variations caused
	by convergences and divergences of the IW induced surface currents,
	and \[ p_{nh} = \rho_0 \int_z^H \frac{Dw}{Dt} dz' \] is the nonhydrostatic
	pressure contribution result from vertical accelerations of fluid
	caused by the wave. In section 2.2 they use small amplitude wave
	theory (i.e. KdV) to predict the form of bottom pressure signals
	under waves of elevation. They find $p_{Wh}$ to be a positive $\mathrm{sech}^2$
	profile, $\rho_0 g \eta_H$ to be a negative $\mathrm{sech}^2$, and
	$p_{nh}$ to be proportional to the 2nd derivative of $\mathrm{sech}^2$.
	They use bottom lander data from the Oregon coast (same data as Moum
	et al 2006) to evaluate the 3 pressure perturbation terms for 4 sets
	of IW trains. Wave speed is estimated from the phase speed of the
	first baroclinic mode from KdV (and from the speed of fluid in the
	crest, though this represents a lower bound). To calculate $p_{nh}$
	they determine each of the terms in \[ \frac{Dw}{Dt} = \frac{\partial
	w}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} + w\frac{\partial
	w}{\partial z}. \] To determine internal hydrostatic pressure, they
	map density profiles taken just before the arrival of the waves to
	streamlines determined from ADCP data. Surface displacement is estimated
	by integrating surface accelerations in $x$. They find maximum surface
	displacements of $\sim$ 1 mm. ADCP beam spreading is a major source
	of error for this, as they cannot measure currents closer than 24m
	below the surface. The pressure disturbance at the seafloor is dominated
	by $p_{Wh}$ and is therefore positive definite. They point out that
	for near surface waves of depression, the surface signature is much
	larger, and because it is opposite to the internal hydrostatic field,
	may actually balance it or at least very much decrease the otherwise
	negative seafloor pressure disturbance, making it hard to detect
	at greater and greater depth.},

  title = {Energy transport by nonlinear internal waves},
  journal = jpo,
  year = {2007},
  volume = {37},
  pages = {1968--1988},
  abstract = {Wintertime stratification on Oregon's continental shelf often produces
	a near-bottom layer of dense fluid that acts as an internal waveguide
	upon which nonlinear internal waves propagate. Shipboard profiling
	and bottom lander observations capture disturbances that exhibit
	properties of internal solitary waves, bores and gravity currents.
	Wave-like pulses are highly turbulent (instantaneous bed stresses
	are 1 N m^2), resuspending bottom sediments into the water column
	and raising them 30+ m above the seafloor. The waves’ cross-shelf
	transport of fluid counters the time-averaged Ekman transport in
	the bottom boundary layer. In the nonlinear internal waves we have
	observed, the kinetic energy is roughly equal to the available potential
	energy and is O(0.1) MJ per m of coastline. The energy transported
	by these waves includes a nonlinear advection term huEi that is negligible
	in linear internal waves. Unlike linear internal waves, the pressure-velocity
	energy flux hupi includes important contributions from nonhydrostatic
	effects and surface displacement. It is found that, statistically,
	<uE> ~= 2<up>. Vertical profiles through these waves of elevation
	indicate that up(z) is more important in transporting energy near
	the seafloor while uE(z) dominates farther from the bottom. With
	the wave speed, c, estimated from weakly nonlinear wave theory, it
	is verified experimentally that the total energy transported by the
	waves, <up>+<uE> ~= c<E>. The high but intermittent energy flux by
	the waves is, in an averaged sense, O(100)W per m of coastline. This
	is similar to independent estimates of the shoreward energy flux
	in the semidiurnal internal tide at the shelfbreak.},
  annote = {They have an extensive set of measurements during winter stratification
	near bottom on the Oregon Shelf. Turbulence profiles, bottom lander
	ADV and ADCP, fixed position CTD casts, shipboard ADCP and echosounder,
	all show aspects of ISWs of elevation advancing onshelf. The observations
	are used to evaluate nonlinear aspects of energy transport. They
	decompose the pressure distribution associated with the wave into
	3 parts (see Moum and Smyth 2006): the internal hydrostatic pressure
	(from isopycnal displacement), external hydrostatic pressure (from
	free surface displacement), and a nonhydrostatic pressure (from vertical
	accelerations). Their framework gives \[ \frac{\partial E}{\partial
	t} + \frac{\partial f_E}{\partial x} + \mbox{vertical redistribution}
	= -\rho_0 \epsilon \] with the horizontal energy flux as \[ f_E =
	u(KE + APE + p_h^w + \rho_0 g \eta_H + p_{nh}) \] \[ f_E = uE + up
	\] where $uE$ is a nonlinear advection term. They ultimately show
	that $\langle f_E\rangle = c\langle E\rangle $ (or $\langle uE +
	up\rangle = c\langle E\rangle $) holds for the observed wave, and
	also that $\langle uE\rangle \simeq 2\langle up\rangle $. In addition
	they find that the nonhydrostatic and external pressure contribute
	significantly to the total pressure-velocity flux, and act to reduce
	it because they are of the opposite sign to the hydrostatic part.
	Also find an equipartition of KE and APE. They also determine that
	$\rho_0 \epsilon$ is negligible over short distances. Their profiling
	and lander series do not coincide, however they focus on the high
	res lander data for the energy calculations. Also of note is that
	they plot vertical profiles of fluxes rather than just vertically
	integrated (fig. 15).},

  abstract = {{Estuarine near-surface turbulence is important for transport, mixing,
	and air-water exchanges of many important constituents but has rarely
	been studied in detail. Here, we analyze a unique set of estuarine
	observations of in situ atmospheric and full water column measurements,
	estimated air-sea exchanges, and acoustic measurements of several
	terms in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) budget. Observations
	from a 5.1 m deep site in the Hudson River estuary include dissipation
	at 50 cm depth (50), as well as profiles of TKE, shear production
	of TKE (P), and net turbulent vertical TKE transport (TD). Regressions
	suggest that the principal controlling factor for 50 was wind (through
	the surface shear velocity, U*) and that the surface heat flux and
	tidal currents played a secondary role. For ebb spring tides, the
	TKE budget at 50 cm depth was closed within noise levels. Ebbs had
	high 50 due to local shear production, which nearly balanced 50.
	Floods had TD approaching P in the upper water column but generally
	weak near-surface shear and turbulence. Examining buoyancy fluxes
	that impact near-surface stratification and can indirectly control
	turbulence, solar heat input and tidal straining caused similar buoyancy
	fluxes on a sunny, calm weather day, promoting ebb tide restratification.
	Wind-driven mixing was found to dominate during a fall season storm
	event, and strong overnight heat loss after the storm helped delay
	restratification afterward. These results demonstrate the utility
	of combining detailed air-sea interaction and physical oceanographic
	measurements in future estuary studies. }},

  abstract = {In the early 1980s, in situ observations were made of the spatial-temporal
	variability of the density field at three separate shelf edge sites
	off the Canadian east coast to improve our understanding of the dynamics
	of the generation, transformation, and dissipation of internal wave
	energy through an analysis of the potential energy budget in the
	water column. A description of the procedure for estimating the perturbation
	potential energy and its principal characteristics is given within
	a conceptual framework, where an internal tide is generated, propagates
	shoreward from the shelf edge, is transformed by nonlinear effects
	into shorter undulations such as solitary waves and internal bores,
	and eventually dissipates. On the basis of observations we find that
	the linear approximation of the potential energy is a major fraction
	of available potential energy, especially in large-amplitude internal
	waves. The potential energy in the generated internal tide is shown
	to covary with the squared current volume flux in the generating
	region. Turbulence and mixing are expected to occur as the short,
	energetic waves become unstable. From the observations, the rate
	of energy dissipation is smallest on the Grand Bank (0.007 W m−2
	over a 30 km distance). In the Scotian Gulf the loss rate is 0.05
	W m−2 over a 13 km distance. At The Gully site, where the energy
	concentrations are the largest, dissipation is estimated to be as
	large as 0.2 W m−2 over a 10 km distance. },

  abstract = {A self-consistent formalism to estimate baroclinic energy densities
	and fluxes resulting from the propagation of internal waves of arbitrary
	amplitude is derived using the concept of available potential energy.
	The method can be applied to numerical, laboratory or field data.
	The total energy flux is shown to be the sum of the linear energy
	flux $\int u'p'\,{\rm d}z$ (primes denote baroclinic quantities),
	plus contributions from the non-hydrostatic pressure anomaly and
	the self-advection of kinetic and available potential energy. Using
	highly resolved observations in Massachusetts Bay, it is shown that
	due to the presence of nonlinear internal waves periodically propagating
	in the area, $\int u'p'\,{\rm d}z$ accounts for only half of the
	total flux. The same data show that equipartition of available potential
	and kinetic energy can be violated, especially when the nonlinear
	waves begin to interact with the bottom.},
  annote = {Another paper highlighting the importance of evaluating nonhydrostatic
	pressure terms, and the self advection of pseudoenergy when determining
	energy fluxes for nonlinear internal waves (either for numerical,
	laboratory, or field data). They test the theory with measurements
	from Massachusetts bay, showing that $\int u'p' dx$ accounts for
	only half of the total flux. Also show that the equipartition of
	KE and APE can be violated. The theory is somewhat hard to follow,
	but the idea seems to be that they develop their energy equation
	relative to a reference state that is generally defined, as follows.
	Let $\bar{\rho} = \bar{\rho}(z,t)$ be a stable reference state. Then
	$z^*(s,t)$ is such that $\bar{\rho}(z^*(s,t),t) = s$. \emph{$z^*$
	is the level at which a density $s$ resides in the reference state????}
	Then \[ \psi = \int_{\rho_0}^{\rho} gz^* ds \] where $\rho = \rho(\mathbf{x},t)$
	and $\mathrm{min}(\rho) < \rho_0 < \mathrm{max}(\rho)$. $\psi$ is
	some kind of potential energy, like the potential energy at a level
	$\rho$ referenced to $\rho_0$? Is basically a generally defined reference
	state. $\psi$ can also be written as \[ \psi = \int_{\bar{\rho}}^{\rho}
	g z^* ds + \bar{\rho}gz - \rho_0 g z_0(t) - g \int_{z_0(t)}^z\bar{\rho}
	dz' \] where $z_0(t) = z^*(\rho_0,t)$, so that the APE is \[ E_p
	= \rho gz - \psi. \] \\ They also include viscous and diffusive terms,
	which would mean that the reference density state is time dependent.
	\emph{There is a close connection here with section 2.2 of Lamb 2007,
	and working these together may help me sort this out}. Their final
	energy equation is: \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(E_k + E_p) + \nabla
	\cdot( \vec{u}(P + E_k + E_p)) = \nabla^2( \nu E_k + \kappa E_p)
	- \epsilon_k - \epsilon_p - 2g \kappa \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(\rho
	- \bar{\rho}) - g \int_{\bar{\rho}}^{\rho} \frac{\partial z^*}{\partial
	t} ds \] where $P$ is the deviation from hydrostatic pressure distribution
	associated with the reference state, and the terms on the right are:
	diffusion, conversion of energy (KE and PE) to internal energy (heat)
	through viscous friction, energy used to irreversibly raise the centre
	of mass through mixing, and changes in $E_p$ due to changes in the
	background state. Note that \[ E_p = g \int_{\bar{\rho}}^{\rho} (z
	- z^*) ds \] For a closed system the energy equation is equivalent
	to that of Winters et al 1995 if $\bar{\rho}$ is chosen to be the
	adiabatic restratification of $\rho$, and $E_p$ is the APE as it
	is commonly known. The mixing terms are globally negative, but locally
	can have either sign. \\Their energy equation does not depend on
	the assumption that $\bar{\rho}$ is an adiabatic restratification
	of $\rho$. In an open system, determining the exact $\bar{\rho}$
	is difficult or impossible (much like Winters et al 1995 state),
	but they state: ``as long as conditions within the domain allow the
	existence of an equilibrium state ($\vec{u} = 0, \rho = \bar{\rho}(z)$),
	one can guess a reasonable value for $\bar{\rho}$, and calculate
	the resulting fluxes." They then proceed to trash Chang et al 2006
	for being so dumb by dropping the nonlinear flux terms. \\ The methods
	are applied to many (tidally generated) packets of IWs. They determine
	$\bar{\rho}$ from data taken just before arrival of the waves. Equipartition
	is better at B than C, because C is shallower. They do like Moum
	and Smyth 2006 and evaluate the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic pressure
	terms. \\ They also evaluate high and low passed fluxes, and find
	that even though the high pass flux is nonzero for about 15\% of
	the tidal cycle, it accounts for 60\% of the total flux averaged
	over the cycle. \\ They estimate dissipation for high and low pass
	fluxes by considering the differences between stations B and C, and
	find that dissipation is only 2.6 times greater as a result of the
	waves.},

	coefficients of the extended Korteweg–de Vries equation. The utility
	of this type of analysis is demonstrated in description of an amplitude-limited,
	flat wave. NLIWs observed over most of the month had typical displacements
	of −8 m, but waves observed from 17–21 August were almost twice as
	large with displacements near −15 m. During most of the month, wave
	packets occurred irregularly at a fixed location, and often more
	than one packet was observed per M2 tidal period. In contrast, the
	arrival times of the large-amplitude wave groups observed over 17–21
	August were more closely phased with the barotropic tide. The time
	span in which the largest NLIWs were observed corresponded to neap
	barotropic conditions, but when the shoreward baroclinic energy flux
	was elevated. During the time of large NLIWs, near-inertial waves
	were a dominate contributor to the internal motions on the shelf

	modulation of the M2 internal tide by the inertial wavefield at the
	shelf break corresponded to stronger/weaker NLIWs on the shelf. }},

  number = {C6},
  abstract = {It is now accepted that double-diffusive processes play a part in
	the mixing of heat and salt in the ocean and that relevant information
	about them can be obtained from laboratory experiments. There is
	still a considerable gap, however, between the laboratory work and
	the conditions under which the phenomena occur in the ocean. Most
	of the laboratory experiments have been one dimensional, whereas
	in the ocean, strong double-diffusive layering is often associated
	with large horizontal gradients of T and S, especially where water
	with one set of T-S properties intrudes at its own density level
	into an environment with different properties. The main purpose of
	the present paper is to report a series of laboratory experiments
	which are related to the latter case. The sugar-salt system and shadowgraph
	photography have been used to explore various situations of increasing
	complexity. The double-diffusive effects are compared with the behavior
	of a simple source of salt solution, which intrudes horizontally
	as a thin layer into a salinity gradient at its own density level.
	In strong contrast to this a source of sugar in the same salinity
	gradient produces vigorous vertical convection near the source, followed
	by spreading at several levels. The extending fluid moves out at
	an angle to the horizontal, rising or falling across isopycnals in
	a manner which can be related to the composition of the environment
	and source fluids and the double-diffusive transports across the
	boundaries of the intrusions. When the ambient fluid is set up with
	opposing gradients, so that potential energy is stored in one of
	the components, there is a more rapid spreading both horizontally
	and vertically, and strong shears are produced. The laboratory results
	are compared with published oceanic data to suggest explanations
	of some existing observations and to predict what might be measurable
	in future work. },

	stratified flow. The goal is to separate adiabatic processes from
	diabatic ones, so as to evaluate changes in APE separately from changes
	in BPE (background PE) and total PE. The model includes dissipation
	and diffusion, and highlights that the distinction between buoyancy
	flux ($-g\overline{\rho w}$) and diabatic mixing. Definitions are:
	\[ E_p = g \int_V \rho z dV \] is the total PE, \[ E_b = g \int_V
	\rho z_*({\bf x},t) dV \] is the background PE, where $z_*({\bf x},t)$
	is the vertical position of a fluid parcel originally at height $z$
	after redistributing the density field. The APE is therefore \[ E_a
	= g \int_V \rho (z - z_*) dV \] as $E_p = E_a + E_b$. They show through
	a numerical simulation of KH instability the temporal evolution of
	$E_p$, $E_a$ and $E_b$ where the creation of $E_a$ through adiabatic
	redistribution of the fluid is subsequently removed through diabatic
	processes (dissipation and diffusion) to increase $E_b$ until after
	a long time $E_p$ and $E_b$ are the same (see Figure 4). They also
	have a nice figure showing a schematic of exchange of energy between
	kinetic, APE, BPE, and internal and external energy, and the associated
	terms and equations that produce those exchanges. Section 6 discusses
	the numerical implementation of calculating the APE and BPE components,
	particularly with regards to the necessary adiabatic redistribution
	of the density field in order to determine the reference density
	(i.e. the minimum potential energy state). A computed background
	density will only be an approximation of the true reference state,
	as each horizontal layer of the sorted field may contain difference
	density elements, which of course is not the case for the true background
	field. They state that as long as the rms fluid displacements exceed
	the vertical grid spacing, the error in the computed APE is insignificant.
	When the fluid displacements were small wrt the grid spacing, interpolation
	of the density field was required before the sorting procedure converged
	to the background profile. Overall, a nice clear oceanographic review
	of APE. I'm not sure how this relates exactly to Shepherd 1993, but
	it is at least more accessible. },

  abstract = {{Internal waves of depression were observed propagating along-shelf
	and into northern Monterey Bay, California (CA) on the inner shelf.
	These waves had amplitudes approximately equal to the thermocline
	depth (∼4 m), and were unstable to shear and mix the thermocline.
	Isopycnal gradient spectra showed that the wave packets lead to an
	elevated mean dissipation rate of = 2.63 × 10−5 m3 s−2 for up to
	2 hours after wave passage. The proximity to the surface created
	strong surface convergences that can actively transport buoyant material,
	such as plankton, back into the bay. The wave packets were observed
	regularly over the upwelling season across multiple years suggesting
	they may have large effects on the documented spatial variation of
	phytoplankton and larvae on the inner shelf. The timing of the waves
	suggests they are not formed by tides interacting with bathymetry,
	but are generated by buoyant plume propagation. }},
