M.~Alford, ``{Redistribution of energy available for ocean mixing by long-range
  propagation of internal waves.}'' \emph{Nature}, vol. 423, no. 6936, pp.
  159--62, 2003.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent Alford presents an attempt to map energy fluxes in
  the internal wave field for the inertial and semidiurnal bands. Previous
  studies (Munk and Wunsch 1998, Wunsch 1998) have shown that the wind and tide
  input enough power ($\sim$ 2 TW) to maintain abyssal stratification, however,
  long range propagation of energy will produce significant differences between
  source and dissipation regions, which with perfect knowledge of sources and
  horizontal flux is given by $D({\bf x}) = S({\bf x}) - \nabla \cdot {\bf
  F(x)}$. Here he uses historical data at 60 locations to compute flux
  magnitudes and directions for near inertial and tidal frequencies. Near
  inertial fluxes are greater in winter, and are predominantly directed
  equatorward, while M$_2$ fluxes radiate away from known source regions and
  are steady throughout the year. Alford estimates the magnitudes of fluxes in
  some of the regions, and determines that globally significant amounts of
  energy are being transported across basins. E.g. $\sim$ 12 GW of inertial
  energy produced in the northern pacific propagates into the south pacific
  where if dissipated uniformly would yield a depth mean dissipation rate of
  10$^{-10}$ W kg$^{-1}$ (typical of background thermocline mixing rates).
  Similarly, calculations near the west pacific trench and Hawaiian ridge
  indicate that much of the internal tidal energy leaves the source region
  ($\sim$50\% and 30\% respectively). \end{quotation}

  field data from the 2004 field season. Successive echogram transects display
  the evolution of a leading ISW from a wavetrain as it shoals and becomes a
  bolus. Echogram transects agree very well with numerical model runs, and with
  previous lab experiments. The aspect ratio (a/L=0.4) of the bolus remains
  relatively constant as it dissipates up the slope. Also used results from
  Bourgault and Kelley 2007 to estimate reflection coefficient R = 0.19.
  Suggest that boluses can propagate quite far onshore until htey are
  dissipated. Also documents the process of waves of elevation forming from
  waves of depression. \end{quotation}

  Cd = 0.2 were found to agree with MI results for dissipation of wave energy
  along the tank. Though MI measured incoming and outgoing wave energies at the
  bas of the slope so as to be able to ignore frictional effects during
  breaking, the reflection coefficient found using the model with free-slip
  sidewalls produced values of R 0.1 higher. Also suggest a parameterization
  for R as a function of Iribarren number. \end{quotation}

  followed by irregular bursts of high rho water lasting ~ 2min. Calculate
  breaking depth from the model, which agrees within uncertainties to the
  criterion of Vlasenko and Hutter (2002). The model reporduces the onshore
  propagating boluses seen in lab experiments. Finally, an intermediate

  breaking, consistant again with the lab experiemnt of Helfrich 1992.

  model (nonlinear and nonhydrostatic) to examine properties of the waves
  compared to KdV theory, and find that for the observed waves (echogram) the
  KdV is not sufficient to describe lengthscale, amplitude, or phase speed.
  They do however find a good agreement for wave energy by comparing that

  calculate the energy of the observed wavetrain. They determine negligible
  energy is lost to shear, and a small calculable fraction to bottom friction.
  The using results from lab experiments (Michallet and Ivey 1999) they
  estimate the increase in potential energy due to mixing caused by the
  breaking wave. From this, they then estimate the eddy diffusivity, which when
  compared to the results of a numerical model at that locale, is 50 times
  greater, suggesting the importance of mixing due to internal waves in
  specific regions. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent They examine the transmission of IWs through an
  ``$N^2$ barrier" and a ``mixed $N^2$ region when there is shear present.
  Essentially an extension of Sutherland and Yewchuck (2004) which didn't
  include shear. The addition of shear requires some stability consideration,
  though they find the timescales for instability are longer than those for
  wave transmission through the barrier. Presence of shear also requires
  consideration of ``Pseudoenergy" instead of energy, due to interaction of the
  waves and the flow. Pseudoenergy is conserved (it is proportional to the
  action) and is given by the energy multiplied by $\omega / \Omega$, where
  $\Omega$ is the relative frequency given by $\Omega(z) = \omega - kU(z)$.
  \emph{How does this pseudoenergy relate to KE + APE??} \\ {\bf More notes:}
  The presence of shear means that tunneling internal waves also have to
  contend with a critical level (where the mean current is equal to the
  horizontal wave speed, so that $\Omega(z) = 0$). As long as the horizontal
  phase speed of the waves matches the flow speed in the upper layer, there is
  no transmission (obviously). If the critical level occurs in the region where
  $N =0$ though, the waves may transmit through it. The reason the waves can
  cross the critical level is because they are evanescent in the shear region,
  not wave-like. In fact, they find nearly perfect transmission for $kL \leq 2$
  and $\omega \leq N_0$ if $Ri = 1$. \\For the mixed $N^2$ barrier (when $N^2$
  is discontinuous), no waves are transmitted when $0 < c < U_0$, however there
  is much more transmission otherwise, as well as a strong transmission spike
  at $\omega \leq N_0$ and $kL \simeq 2.4$. In other words, the presence of
  density discontinuities serves to enhance transmission when no critical level
  is reached, but completely inhibits it otherwise. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent This paper is the butt end of criticism from Lamb
  2007, Scotti et al 2006, and Moum et al 2006, for not including nonlinear
  self advection of energy in their energy flux calculations. They first
  calculate internal wave energy by computing spectra, and then integrating the
  spectra over frequency bands of interest (NLIW band, semidiurnal band,
  diurnal band). To overcome the fact that 2 of their ADCPs only covered the
  upper half of the water column, they used normal mode analysis to compute
  vertically integrated energies. \\ They compute energy flux two ways, \[
  \vec{F} = \int \vec{C_g} E dz \] and \[ \vec{F} = \int <p' \vec{u}' dz \]
  $\vec{C_g}$ is determined separately for the NLIWs (from some kind of
  harmonic analysis?) and for the tides (from IW dispersion relation and normal
  mode analysis). They calculate $p'$ by \[ p' = p_{surf} + \int_z^0 \rho' g dz
  \] where $\rho'$ is estimated from isopycnal displacement determined from
  time integration of the vertical velocity. Because of the large difference in
  energy flux between 2 stations, they estimate that dissipation is the cause,
  and calculated a kinetic energy dissipation rate as \[ \varepsilon =
  \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta s} \] To get this they take the energy equation \[
  \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + ( \vec{u} \cdot \nabla) E = \nabla \cdot
  \vec{F} - \varepsilon \] and assume $\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$ and
  $(\vec{u} \dot \nabla) E$ are small. For NLIWs this clearly is no good as the
  previously mention critiquing papers show that the self advection can account
  for $\sim$50\% of the energy flux. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent Another paper examing internal solitary wave
  packets generated from tidal flow over a shelf break using satellite SAR
  images. Of particular not here is that they identify waves with two different
  generation mechanisms: the typical barotropic tidal flow over the shelf break
  to generate high frequency interfacial waves, and a mechanism termed ``local
  generation'' which involves generation of an internal tidal beam at the shelf
  break which re-emerges at the surface some distance away, causing internal
  wave generation through interaction with the pycnocline there. Also of note
  is they produce maps of the ``barotropic body force'' of Baines (1982) and
  use this to justify the particular shelf break region as being an internal
  wave hot-spot. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent An article describing the latest techniques for
  determining Thorpe scales from ship-lowered CTD profiles. The authors address
  several important issues, including: the need to identify and correct ship
  effects, optimizing the calculation of density - necessary because of
  salinity spiking and thermal lag effects arising from sensor limitations, and
  validation of overturn identification - both due to random noise and residual
  sensor effects. The authors compare heavily against Galbraith and Kelley
  1996, whose criteria they found did not work adequately enough for their data
  set. In particular, they believe that a diagnostic based on measurement of
  tightness with the T-S relationship (such as that used by GK96( is not
  warranted, and therefore not recommended. Applying techniques such as this to
  much of the world CTD profiles, however, could begin to produce an
  interesting database of mixing and turbulence measurements, without the use
  of microstructure profilers. \end{quotation}

  which has a solitary wave solution \[ \eta = \frac{\eta_0}{b +
  (1-b)\mathrm{cosh}^2 \gamma (x-ct)} \] which reduces to the familiar sech$^2$
  when $\alpha_2=0$. Large amplitude models include MCC (which agrees with eKdV
  for $0.4 < \frac{h_1}{h_1 + h_2} < 0.6$). Also discussed is the theory of
  Ostrovsky and Grue 2003, which does not suffer from KH instability of large
  amplitude waves like MCC. The equation is the phenomenological derivation of
  KdV \[ \eta_t + c(\eta)\eta_x + (\beta (\eta) \eta_{xx})_x = 0 \] where
  $c(\eta)$ is the exact nonlinear speed from nondispersive theory. Also
  discuss various authors that consider fully nonlinear models (e.g. see Lamb
  2002/2003, Turkington 1991). \\Then they summarize various lab experiments.
  \\Wave generation by tides (Halpern 1971): initial generation of a front
  upstream due to ``blocking" by topography, nonlinear steepening of the front,
  then generation of a wave packet by the combined effects of nonlinearity and
  dispersion. Also discuss Knight Inlet where the plunging thermocline causes
  the accelerating lower layer flow to become unstable to shear instabilities
  which may develop into ISWs. \\Evolution is governed by changes in topography
  and stratification, and rotation. In particular they note the recently
  detected waves of elevation (Klymak and Moum 2003, etc) which often show
  transitions from waves of depression to elevation (e.g. South China Sea). The
  effect of rotation generally is to damp solitary wave solutions, often
  through radiation of Poincare waves. They discussion dissipation due to its
  importance for transport and mixing. Methods of dissipation are: radiation
  damping (NLIWs propagating over a weakly stratified lower layer may radiate
  internal waves into it), boundary shear (e.g. bottom boundary
  shear/turbulence/dissipation), shear instability ($Ri < 1/4$ can produce
  thickening of the interface - i.e. greater PE at the expense of the ISWs,
  most likely caused by KH instability - see Moum et al 2003), and wave
  breaking. Breaking often occurs in the vicinity of the turning point ($h_1 =
  h_2$), and is followed by the formation of boluses. Lamb 2003 examined the
  idea of trapped cores. Mixing efficiency as a result of breaking is usually
  between 15-25 \%. \end{quotation}

  photographs. Hydrographic and current data taken during the same phase of the
  tide but two years later do reveal nonlinear internal waves passing an
  anchored ship. The generation mechanism is not believed to be topographic,

  water fronts occuring near the the head of the laurentian channel which break
  down due to dispersion and nonlinearity into a train of internal waves.

 \begin{quotation}\noindent The authors examine the internal wave field in a
  submarine canyon, using XCP-XCTD pairs, bottom mounted ADCPs, and CTD time
  series. Canyons are often areas of increased biological productivity,
  possibly due to upwelling and subsequent upcanyon flow. Enhanced turbulence
  from an enhanced internal wave field may also contribute. Canyons may
  contribute to higher turbulence through focusing of internal waves and
  critical reflection off the bottom. \\ Sampling included across canyon
  transects, repeated four times in 12h, an along canyon transect, and various
  measurements on the submarine fan and slope. ADCPs were mounted near the
  shallow end of the canyon. Isopycnal displacement ($\xi$) was calculated from
  XCTD/XCP data relative to averages over the entire survey. Energy fluxes were
  then determined from $\langle \tilde{u} \tilde{p} \rangle$, where $\tilde{p}$
  was calculated from the survey averaged $N^2$ and isopycnal profiles assuming
  a hydrostatic balance. They note that this holds for frequencies $\omega \ll
  N$, and is therefore appropriate for the mostly semidiurnal fluctuations. \\
  They produce frequency spectra from the ADCP. For $f < \omega < N$ it
  resembles the GM1979 spectrum except for: there is no inertial peak, a
  dominant semidiurnal peak, the presence of M2 and K1 harmonics, and excess
  energy near $N$ (probably caused by instrument noise). They calculate KE and
  APE along and across the canyon, using \[ PE = \frac{\bar{N}^2 \langle \xi^2
  \rangle}{2} \] but to remove the barotropic component they subtract a linear
  fit for $\xi$ (with zero at the surface) from the isopycnal displacements
  (i.e. $\tilde{\xi} = \xi - \xi_z z$). Not doing this can lead to KE/PE ratios
  that are too low. There are a number of plots showing the energy along and
  across the canyon, showing baroclinic energies are elevated compared to
  open-ocean values, especially toward the head of the canyon. \\They also
  estimate finescale shear and strain variance, which they use for estimates of
  turbulent diffusion using several different parameterizations. They find they
  best parameterization underestimates microstructure measurements by a factor
  of 30, implying that open-ocean parameterizations are not valid in the
  canyon, and that turbulence there is produced in a fundamentally different
  way (either through enhanced wave-wave interactions, the departure from the
  GM spectrum, or interaction with canyon topography). \\They estimate flux
  magnitudes and direction, finding that they are mostly oriented up-canyon,
  and in some cases seem to be able to navigate bends with little loss. They
  then combine the flux and dissipation rate to see whether the loss of energy
  goes to turbulence (using steady state and weak advection assumptions) i.e.
  \[ \frac{\Delta \langle \tilde{u}\tilde{p} \rangle}{\Delta r} = \varepsilon_p
  = \varepsilon(1+\gamma) \] where $\gamma$ is the mixing efficiency. They find
  that flux convergences are comparable to $\varepsilon_p$, though it is not
  just simple upcanyon dissipation as there must be sources and sinks to
  explain the observed flux. This implies that if internal tide generation is
  important in the canyon, that might control turbulence rather than an
  internal wave cascade. \end{quotation}

  cores formed via shoaling},'' \emph{Journal of Fluid Mechanics}, vol. 451,
  pp. 109--144, 2002.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent Lamb examines the formation of trapped cores for
  shoaling solitary waves of depression, with a variety of different
  stratifications, and shelf widths. He uses an exponential stratification
  (with 3 different scale heights of 15, 35, and 75 m), a tanh profile with
  scale heights of 20 and 45 m (making them similar to the exponential
  profiles), and a mixed-layer profile which is a modification of the S=15m
  exponential to include a 2 m thick surface mixed layer. There are 3 limits to
  wave amplitude that are of relevance. The breaking limit occurs when the
  maximum velocity in the wave ($U_{max}$) is equal to the wave speed $c$. At
  this point, a streamline in a reference frame moving with the wave, first
  becomes vertical. The conjugate flow limit occurs for waves that become flat
  in the centre and simply become longer as the amplitude increases (Benjamin
  1966, Lamb and Wan 1998). Finally, the stability limit occurs when the
  minimum Richardson number near the wave goes below 0.25, though this is not a
  set in stone criterion, as the flow in a NLIW is not parallel. \\Note that a
  trapped core occurs when a wave core exhibits closed streamlines. Trapped
  cores are significant because they have the potential to transport fluid over
  large distances. \\ By comparing theoretical properties of waves for the
  exponential and mixed-layer stratifications, Lamb shows that the maximum wave
  currents in large solitary waves are sensitive to changes in the near-surface
  density. \\Numerical experiments illustrate many aspects of varying amplitude
  waves shoaling over the shelf for the indicated stratifications, and for 3
  different shelf widths of 200, 400, and 600 m. Structure of the trapped
  cores, evolution of wave amplitudes and velocities, and breaking depths are
  all elucidated with detailed figures. Some preliminary energetics
  calculations are also performed. \\ Results indicate that trapped cores can
  form after breaking for the exponential and tanh stratifications, but
  \emph{do not} occur for the mixed layer profile. While the maximum amplitude
  of the solitary waves after adjusting on the shallower shelf (and perhaps
  after having formed a trapped core) is usually governed by the breaking
  limit, the amplitude for waves in the mixed-layer case is instead governed by
  the conjugate flow limit. Breaking for trapped core forming waves can occur
  on the shelf, while for the mixed-layer it always occurs over the slope.
  These results imply that waves with trapped cores will not be formed in the
  ocean under most oceanographic conditions. \\ \\ \textbf{Some extra notes on
  limits for large amplitude waves:} \\ ISW amplitude is limited by one of 3
  things: the breaking limit, the conjugate flow limit, and the stability
  limit. Different limits are important for different stratifications and
  configurations. \\ The breaking limit occurs when $U_{max} = c$, at which
  point overturning occurs and a trapped core may be formed. \\ For waves
  governed by the conjugate flow limit, $U_{max} < c$ and trapped cores are not
  formed, even if breaking occurs. Higher energy waves become broader instead
  of higher, and all streamlines are open. \end{quotation}

\bibitem{Lamb:2003}
------, ``{Shoaling solitary internal waves: on a criterion for the formation
  of waves with trapped cores},'' \emph{Journal of Fluid Mechanics}, vol. 478,
  pp. 81--100, 2003.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent An extension of the numerical experiments in Lamb
  2002, extended to look at oceanographically relevant stratifications (i.e.
  tanh profiles), and including background current shear near the surface. In
  Lamb 2002 he found that trapped cores would not form when there was a surface
  mixed layer, and the maximum amplitude of the waves was governed by the
  conjugate flow limit ($U_{max} < c$). In the intro he states \\ \emph{``The
  reason for the significant difference in the limiting behavior of large waves
  ... is that in the mixed layer there is no mechanism for the generation of
  vorticity."} \\This suggests however, that a surface current with vorticity
  in the same direction can enable the formation of trapped cores in a
  stratification that otherwise wouldn't support it. \\Lamb and Wan 1998 found
  that conjugate flows with open streaklines (i.e. not trapped cores) exist
  only when the centre of the pycnocline is greater than a critical distance
  $r(d)$ from the upper (wave of depression) or lower (waves of elevation)
  boundary ($d$ is the pycnocline thickness). \\The results with no background
  current are summarized in figure 3, where trapped cores only form if $z_0$
  (pycnocline depth) is greater than $r_u(d)$ for various values of $d$. In all
  cases shoaling waves steepen at the back and if of sufficient amplitude they
  overturn. For conjugate flow limited waves ($z_0 < r_u(d)$) a patch of surf
  formed at the rear of the wave during overturning is left behind, and waves
  with amplitudes larger than the limit flatten out from the front (see figure
  4a). If $z_0$ is above $r_u(d)$ there is a persistent surf near the rear, and
  for $z_0 > r_u(d)$ the closed density contours fill more of the wave.
  \\Adding a sheared background current modifies the $r_u(d)$ curve (figure 6),
  but it is still found that trapped cores only form when $z_0 > r_u(d)$. Now
  however, $r_u(d)$ is generally lower than with no current, meaning trapped
  cores can be formed for stratifications that couldn't previously. In other
  words, as the background shear increases, $r_u(d)$ decreases. \\He closes by
  stating: \emph{``The numerical calculation of conjugate flows for a specified
  stratification and background current is computationally very cheap and
  provides a simple means to determine whether waves with trapped cores can
  exist."} How true it is. \end{quotation}

------, ``Energy and pseudoenergy flux in the internal wave field generated by
  tidal flow over topography,'' \emph{Continental Shelf Research}, vol.~27,
  no.~9, pp. 1208--1232, 2007.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent Lamb examines aspects of tidal flow over topography
  using a nonlinear nonhydrostatic 2D numerical model. He examines 2 cases:
  weak tidal flow with constant N over a deep ocean ridge, and strong tidal
  flow over a bank edge with nonuniform stratification. He evaluates the fluxes
  of total mechanical energy and pseudoenergy for the cases, while evaluating
  contributions from various flux terms, including: flux of background and
  perturbation potential energy, rate of work done by background and
  perturbation pressure fields, and flux of kinetic energy. (Note that he
  points out that the perturbation pressure field may further be decomposed
  into hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic parts, following Moum et al 2006 and
  Venayagamoorthy and Fringer 2005, 2006). The total mechanical energy equation
  is of the form: \[ \frac{d \bar{E}}{dt} = \left. \left[ (PE_{f1} + W_1) +
  PE_{f2} + W_2 + K_f \right] \right|_{\xi_r}^{\xi_l} \] and the pseudoenergy
  equation is: \[ \frac{d \bar{E}_{pseudo}}{dt} = \left. (K_f + APE_f + W_2)
  \right|_{\xi_r}^{\xi_l}. \] Lamb finds that both equations are satisfied to
  less than 1\%, indicating that using a linear energy equation (i.e.
  considering only the pressure work terms in the flux) is not appropriate for
  the bank edge case. In fact, the $\langle up \rangle$ term accounts for only
  $\sim$1/2 of the pseudoenergy flux. This is consistent with other studies, in
  particular Moum et al 2006 and Scotti et al 2006, and reinforces that much of
  the internal wave energy generated by tide-topography interaction ends up in
  the high frequency nonhydrostatic ISW field. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent They have an extensive set of measurements during
  winter stratification near bottom on the Oregon Shelf. Turbulence profiles,
  bottom lander ADV and ADCP, fixed position CTD casts, shipboard ADCP and
  echosounder, all show aspects of ISWs of elevation advancing onshelf. The
  observations are used to evaluate nonlinear aspects of energy transport. They
  decompose the pressure distribution associated with the wave into 3 parts
  (see Moum and Smyth 2006): the internal hydrostatic pressure (from isopycnal
  displacement), external hydrostatic pressure (from free surface
  displacement), and a nonhydrostatic pressure (from vertical accelerations).
  Their framework gives \[ \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial
  f_E}{\partial x} + \mbox{vertical redistribution} = -\rho_0 \epsilon \] with
  the horizontal energy flux as \[ f_E = u(KE + APE + p_h^w + \rho_0 g \eta_H +
  p_{nh}) \] \[ f_E = uE + up \] where $uE$ is a nonlinear advection term. They
  ultimately show that $\langle f_E\rangle = c\langle E\rangle $ (or $\langle
  uE + up\rangle = c\langle E\rangle $) holds for the observed wave, and also
  that $\langle uE\rangle \simeq 2\langle up\rangle $. In addition they find
  that the nonhydrostatic and external pressure contribute significantly to the
  total pressure-velocity flux, and act to reduce it because they are of the
  opposite sign to the hydrostatic part. Also find an equipartition of KE and
  APE. They also determine that $\rho_0 \epsilon$ is negligible over short
  distances. Their profiling and lander series do not coincide, however they
  focus on the high res lander data for the energy calculations. Also of note
  is that they plot vertical profiles of fluxes rather than just vertically
  integrated (fig. 15). \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent In this paper, the authors assess the contributions
  to the pressure field under a nonhydrostatic non-linear internal wave. Their
  discussion focuses on near bottom waves of elevation, though it could be
  extended to waves of depression (which tend to be near the surface), and they
  discuss some of the issues involved in this in Section 9.3. The consider the
  total pressure at a depth $z$ to be: \[ p = p_U + p_{Wh} + \rho_0 g \eta_H +
  p_{nh} \] where \[ p_U = \int_z^H (\rho_0 + \rho_U) g dz' \] is the upstream
  (or ambient) pressure field (i.e. the background), \[ p_{Wh} = \int_z^H
  \rho_{Wh} g dz' \] is the pressure anomaly associated with the wave, i.e. the
  internal hydrostatic pressure, \[ \rho_0 g \eta_H \] is the pressure
  associated with surface variations caused by convergences and divergences of
  the IW induced surface currents, and \[ p_{nh} = \rho_0 \int_z^H
  \frac{Dw}{Dt} dz' \] is the nonhydrostatic pressure contribution result from
  vertical accelerations of fluid caused by the wave. In section 2.2 they use
  small amplitude wave theory (i.e. KdV) to predict the form of bottom pressure
  signals under waves of elevation. They find $p_{Wh}$ to be a positive
  $\mathrm{sech}^2$ profile, $\rho_0 g \eta_H$ to be a negative
  $\mathrm{sech}^2$, and $p_{nh}$ to be proportional to the 2nd derivative of
  $\mathrm{sech}^2$. They use bottom lander data from the Oregon coast (same
  data as Moum et al 2006) to evaluate the 3 pressure perturbation terms for 4
  sets of IW trains. Wave speed is estimated from the phase speed of the first
  baroclinic mode from KdV (and from the speed of fluid in the crest, though
  this represents a lower bound). To calculate $p_{nh}$ they determine each of
  the terms in \[ \frac{Dw}{Dt} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial t} +
  u\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} + w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}. \] To
  determine internal hydrostatic pressure, they map density profiles taken just
  before the arrival of the waves to streamlines determined from ADCP data.
  Surface displacement is estimated by integrating surface accelerations in
  $x$. They find maximum surface displacements of $\sim$ 1 mm. ADCP beam
  spreading is a major source of error for this, as they cannot measure
  currents closer than 24m below the surface. The pressure disturbance at the
  seafloor is dominated by $p_{Wh}$ and is therefore positive definite. They
  point out that for near surface waves of depression, the surface signature is
  much larger, and because it is opposite to the internal hydrostatic field,
  may actually balance it or at least very much decrease the otherwise negative
  seafloor pressure disturbance, making it hard to detect at greater and
  greater depth. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent Another paper highlighting the importance of
  evaluating nonhydrostatic pressure terms, and the self advection of
  pseudoenergy when determining energy fluxes for nonlinear internal waves
  (either for numerical, laboratory, or field data). They test the theory with
  measurements from Massachusetts bay, showing that $\int u'p' dx$ accounts for
  only half of the total flux. Also show that the equipartition of KE and APE
  can be violated. The theory is somewhat hard to follow, but the idea seems to
  be that they develop their energy equation relative to a reference state that
  is generally defined, as follows. Let $\bar{\rho} = \bar{\rho}(z,t)$ be a
  stable reference state. Then $z^*(s,t)$ is such that $\bar{\rho}(z^*(s,t),t)
  = s$. \emph{$z^*$ is the level at which a density $s$ resides in the
  reference state????} Then \[ \psi = \int_{\rho_0}^{\rho} gz^* ds \] where
  $\rho = \rho(\mathbf{x},t)$ and $\mathrm{min}(\rho) < \rho_0 <
  \mathrm{max}(\rho)$. $\psi$ is some kind of potential energy, like the
  potential energy at a level $\rho$ referenced to $\rho_0$? Is basically a
  generally defined reference state. $\psi$ can also be written as \[ \psi =
  \int_{\bar{\rho}}^{\rho} g z^* ds + \bar{\rho}gz - \rho_0 g z_0(t) - g
  \int_{z_0(t)}^z\bar{\rho} dz' \] where $z_0(t) = z^*(\rho_0,t)$, so that the
  APE is \[ E_p = \rho gz - \psi. \] \\ They also include viscous and diffusive
  terms, which would mean that the reference density state is time dependent.
  \emph{There is a close connection here with section 2.2 of Lamb 2007, and
  working these together may help me sort this out}. Their final energy
  equation is: \[ \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(E_k + E_p) + \nabla \cdot(
  \vec{u}(P + E_k + E_p)) = \nabla^2( \nu E_k + \kappa E_p) - \epsilon_k -
  \epsilon_p - 2g \kappa \frac{\partial}{\partial z}(\rho - \bar{\rho}) - g
  \int_{\bar{\rho}}^{\rho} \frac{\partial z^*}{\partial t} ds \] where $P$ is
  the deviation from hydrostatic pressure distribution associated with the
  reference state, and the terms on the right are: diffusion, conversion of
  energy (KE and PE) to internal energy (heat) through viscous friction, energy
  used to irreversibly raise the centre of mass through mixing, and changes in
  $E_p$ due to changes in the background state. Note that \[ E_p = g
  \int_{\bar{\rho}}^{\rho} (z - z^*) ds \] For a closed system the energy
  equation is equivalent to that of Winters et al 1995 if $\bar{\rho}$ is
  chosen to be the adiabatic restratification of $\rho$, and $E_p$ is the APE
  as it is commonly known. The mixing terms are globally negative, but locally
  can have either sign. \\Their energy equation does not depend on the
  assumption that $\bar{\rho}$ is an adiabatic restratification of $\rho$. In
  an open system, determining the exact $\bar{\rho}$ is difficult or impossible
  (much like Winters et al 1995 state), but they state: ``as long as conditions
  within the domain allow the existence of an equilibrium state ($\vec{u} = 0,
  \rho = \bar{\rho}(z)$), one can guess a reasonable value for $\bar{\rho}$,
  and calculate the resulting fluxes." They then proceed to trash Chang et al
  2006 for being so dumb by dropping the nonlinear flux terms. \\ The methods
  are applied to many (tidally generated) packets of IWs. They determine
  $\bar{\rho}$ from data taken just before arrival of the waves. Equipartition
  is better at B than C, because C is shallower. They do like Moum and Smyth
  2006 and evaluate the hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic pressure terms. \\ They
  also evaluate high and low passed fluxes, and find that even though the high
  pass flux is nonzero for about 15\% of the tidal cycle, it accounts for 60\%
  of the total flux averaged over the cycle. \\ They estimate dissipation for
  high and low pass fluxes by considering the differences between stations B
  and C, and find that dissipation is only 2.6 times greater as a result of the
  waves. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent Shepherd rederives APE in several contexts
  (acoustic waves, Lorenz's APE, compressible stratified fluid, and for a
  non-resting basic state) using a Hamiltonian formalism. In this context,
  conservation laws for non-canonical systems are not connected to explicit
  symmetries of the Hamiltonian, but arise from the degenerate nature of the
  Poisson bracket. These are known as {\emph Casimir Invariants}. These ideas
  arose due to the fact that in order to produce an equation for conservation
  of pseudoenergy (KE + APE), additional conservation laws (i.e. mass
  conservation) had to be combined with traditional energy conservation laws.
  Most of the paper is pretty heavy and unreadable without a strong Hamiltonian
  mechanics background, but the intro and conclusion summarize the issue pretty
  well. For a clear summary of APE see Winters et al 1995. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent They look at the concept of APE and how it relates
  to mixing in density stratified flow. The goal is to separate adiabatic
  processes from diabatic ones, so as to evaluate changes in APE separately
  from changes in BPE (background PE) and total PE. The model includes
  dissipation and diffusion, and highlights that the distinction between
  buoyancy flux ($-g\overline{\rho w}$) and diabatic mixing. Definitions are:
  \[ E_p = g \int_V \rho z dV \] is the total PE, \[ E_b = g \int_V \rho
  z_*({\bf x},t) dV \] is the background PE, where $z_*({\bf x},t)$ is the
  vertical position of a fluid parcel originally at height $z$ after
  redistributing the density field. The APE is therefore \[ E_a = g \int_V \rho
  (z - z_*) dV \] as $E_p = E_a + E_b$. They show through a numerical
  simulation of KH instability the temporal evolution of $E_p$, $E_a$ and $E_b$
  where the creation of $E_a$ through adiabatic redistribution of the fluid is
  subsequently removed through diabatic processes (dissipation and diffusion)
  to increase $E_b$ until after a long time $E_p$ and $E_b$ are the same (see
  Figure 4). They also have a nice figure showing a schematic of exchange of
  energy between kinetic, APE, BPE, and internal and external energy, and the
  associated terms and equations that produce those exchanges. Section 6
  discusses the numerical implementation of calculating the APE and BPE
  components, particularly with regards to the necessary adiabatic
  redistribution of the density field in order to determine the reference
  density (i.e. the minimum potential energy state). A computed background
  density will only be an approximation of the true reference state, as each
  horizontal layer of the sorted field may contain difference density elements,
  which of course is not the case for the true background field. They state
  that as long as the rms fluid displacements exceed the vertical grid spacing,
  the error in the computed APE is insignificant. When the fluid displacements
  were small wrt the grid spacing, interpolation of the density field was
  required before the sorting procedure converged to the background profile.
  Overall, a nice clear oceanographic review of APE. I'm not sure how this
  relates exactly to Shepherd 1993, but it is at least more accessible.
